  - audit_id: gamification-behavioral.reward-systems.reward-schedule
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/22-gamification-behavioral/reward-systems/reward-schedule.yaml
    dimension: CLARITY
    severity: low
    issue: |
      Signal RWDSCH-CRIT-001 uses term "targeting vulnerable populations" without
      defining what constitutes targeting vs. incidental access. The distinction
      between "accessible to minors" and "targeting minors" is legally significant
      but left ambiguous in evidence_indicators.
    recommendation: |
      Add explicit criteria distinguishing incidental accessibility from intentional
      targeting. Include examples: "Marketing materials feature young users" vs.
      "Age verification exists but minors may bypass."

  - audit_id: gamification-behavioral.reward-systems.reward-schedule
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/22-gamification-behavioral/reward-systems/reward-schedule.yaml
    dimension: ACTIONABILITY
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      Code patterns (gamif|reward|achievement|badge|point|level) are identical
      across ALL gamification audits. This generic pattern will match the same
      files regardless of whether auditing reward schedules, achievements, or
      leaderboards - providing no specificity for this audit's unique concerns
      about variable ratio reinforcement schedules.
    recommendation: |
      Add reward-schedule-specific patterns:
      - pattern: (random|variable|chance|probability|odds|drop.?rate|loot)
      - pattern: (slot|spin|gacha|pull|roll)
      - pattern: (pity|mercy|guarantee|floor)
      These would actually surface gambling-mechanic-relevant code.

  - audit_id: gamification-behavioral.reward-systems.streak-mechanism
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/22-gamification-behavioral/reward-systems/streak-mechanism.yaml
    dimension: AGENT-READINESS
    severity: high
    issue: |
      Audit marked "automatable: partial" but Step 2 (User Experience Assessment)
      requires analyzing "user feedback, support tickets, and reviews about
      streak experience" - qualitative sentiment analysis that requires access
      to systems an agent likely cannot reach (support ticketing systems,
      app store reviews). Step 4 requires conducting stakeholder interviews
      (1.5 hours) which is entirely non-automatable.
    recommendation: |
      Either: (a) Split into automated pre-check and manual deep-dive phases, or
      (b) Change to "automatable: manual" with clear documentation that agent
      can only perform Steps 1 and 3 (mechanic analysis, pattern detection),
      flagging remaining steps as requiring human execution.

  - audit_id: gamification-behavioral.reward-systems.streak-mechanism
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/22-gamification-behavioral/reward-systems/streak-mechanism.yaml
    dimension: CLARITY
    severity: low
    issue: |
      Signal STRK-CRIT-002 evidence indicator "Late-night/vacation engagement to
      maintain streaks" presumes access to user behavior analytics with time-of-day
      granularity. The audit doesn't specify how an auditor without analytics access
      should assess this indicator.
    recommendation: |
      Add alternative evidence paths: "User complaints about needing to engage
      during vacation/illness" or "Design docs show no timezone accommodation"
      as proxy indicators when direct analytics unavailable.

  - audit_id: gamification-behavioral.engagement-ethics.compulsion-loop-assessment
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/22-gamification-behavioral/engagement-ethics/compulsion-loop-assessment.yaml
    dimension: AGENT-READINESS
    severity: critical
    issue: |
      Audit marked "automatable: manual" and "severity: critical" with estimated
      duration 4-6 hours. The entire audit depends on interviews (Product Designer
      45min, Data Analyst 30min, User Researcher 30min, Support Lead 30min) and
      qualitative document review. An LLM agent cannot execute ANY step
      autonomously - it can only prepare interview questions and analyze
      artifacts IF provided.
    recommendation: |
      Add explicit "agent_role" field specifying: "Agent can prepare interview
      guides, analyze provided artifacts, and draft findings synthesis. Agent
      CANNOT conduct interviews or access behavioral analytics independently.
      Requires human orchestration throughout."

  - audit_id: gamification-behavioral.engagement-ethics.compulsion-loop-assessment
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/22-gamification-behavioral/engagement-ethics/compulsion-loop-assessment.yaml
    dimension: ALIGNMENT
    severity: low
    issue: |
      Audit references "ethical-societal.addiction-manipulation.variable-reward-pattern"
      in relationships.commonly_combined, but this creates potential scope creep.
      The compulsion-loop-assessment and variable-reward-pattern audits have
      significant conceptual overlap - unclear when to use one vs. the other.
    recommendation: |
      Add explicit scope boundaries in description.what explaining when this
      audit should be chosen over the ethical-societal variant. Consider:
      "Use this audit for product-level engagement design review; use
      ethical-societal.addiction-manipulation for component-level pattern analysis."

  - audit_id: gamification-behavioral.social-mechanics.leaderboard-design
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/22-gamification-behavioral/social-mechanics/leaderboard-design.yaml
    dimension: CLARITY
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      Signal LDBRD-CRIT-001 indicator "Vulnerable populations (minors, mental health)
      exposed" conflates two very different vulnerability types requiring different
      mitigations. Minors require age-gating and parental controls; mental health
      concerns require content warnings and opt-outs. Single signal masks distinct
      remediation paths.
    recommendation: |
      Split into separate signals or sub-indicators:
      - LDBRD-CRIT-001a: Minor exposure without parental controls
      - LDBRD-CRIT-001b: Mental health vulnerable users without opt-out
      Each with targeted remediation.

  - audit_id: gamification-behavioral.social-mechanics.leaderboard-design
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/22-gamification-behavioral/social-mechanics/leaderboard-design.yaml
    dimension: ACTIONABILITY
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      Code patterns identical to other gamification audits (gamif|reward|achievement).
      Leaderboard-specific code typically uses different vocabulary: rank, position,
      score, standings, top, best, compare, versus. Current patterns would miss
      leaderboard implementations not using gamification keywords.
    recommendation: |
      Add leaderboard-specific patterns:
      - pattern: (leaderboard|ranking|standings|top.?\d+|high.?score)
      - pattern: (compare|versus|beat|compete|outperform)
      - pattern: (position|place|tier|division|league)

  - audit_id: gamification-behavioral.feedback-loops.habit-formation-ethics
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/22-gamification-behavioral/feedback-loops/habit-formation-ethics.yaml
    dimension: CLARITY
    severity: high
    issue: |
      Core distinction between "persuasion" and "coercion" in description.what
      is philosophically significant but not operationally defined. Auditors
      need concrete criteria to classify mechanics. The audit says it "distinguishes"
      these but never provides the distinguishing test.
    recommendation: |
      Add explicit decision framework, e.g.:
      "Persuasion Test: (1) Does user explicitly want this outcome? (2) Would
      user approve if fully informed of mechanics? (3) Can user easily stop?
      If all yes = persuasion. Any no = potential coercion. Two+ no = coercion."

  - audit_id: gamification-behavioral.feedback-loops.habit-formation-ethics
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/22-gamification-behavioral/feedback-loops/habit-formation-ethics.yaml
    dimension: AGENT-READINESS
    severity: high
    issue: |
      Signal HBTFM-CRIT-003 "Habits serve business not users" requires value
      judgment an LLM cannot definitively make. Evidence indicator "Users would
      not choose these habits" requires counterfactual reasoning about user
      preferences that requires human judgment or user research data.
    recommendation: |
      Reframe as observable indicators: "No user-facing value proposition for
      habit feature," "Metrics track business outcomes only (DAU, revenue) not
      user outcomes (satisfaction, goal completion)," "No user research validating
      habit desirability."

  # CATEGORY 23: EMOTIONAL-DESIGN-TRUST
  # =============================================================================

  - audit_id: emotional-design-trust.trust-signals.trust-seal-validity
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/23-emotional-design-trust/trust-signals/trust-seal-validity.yaml
    dimension: ACTIONABILITY
    severity: high
    issue: |
      File patterns target common config locations but trust seals are typically
      in frontend HTML/templates, not configuration files. Pattern "**/*.{yaml,json}"
      will miss seals embedded in JSX, HTML, Vue templates, or image assets
      referenced in CSS.
    recommendation: |
      Add frontend-specific patterns:
      - glob: '**/*.{html,htm,jsx,tsx,vue,svelte}'
        purpose: Template files containing seal markup
      - glob: '**/assets/**/*seal*'
        purpose: Seal image assets
      - glob: '**/components/**/*trust*'
        purpose: Trust-related UI components

  - audit_id: emotional-design-trust.trust-signals.trust-seal-validity
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/23-emotional-design-trust/trust-signals/trust-seal-validity.yaml
    dimension: AGENT-READINESS
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      Verification of actual certification validity requires external API calls
      or manual verification with issuing authorities (BBB, McAfee, Norton).
      Audit doesn't specify how to verify beyond "check if certification is current"
      - an agent needs URLs or APIs for programmatic verification.
    recommendation: |
      Add verification_resources section with:
      - BBB verification URL patterns
      - Common seal registry APIs
      - Whois-style lookup services for security seals
      Or explicitly mark external verification as human-required step.

  - audit_id: emotional-design-trust.trust-signals.testimonial-authenticity
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/23-emotional-design-trust/trust-signals/testimonial-authenticity.yaml
    dimension: CLARITY
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      FTC compliance requirements referenced but specific FTC Endorsement Guidelines
      requirements not enumerated. Auditors need to know specific requirements:
      material connection disclosure, typical results disclosure, substantiation
      requirements. Reference to "FTC compliance" is too vague for actionable audit.
    recommendation: |
      Add explicit FTC requirements checklist:
      - Material connections disclosed (paid, gifted, employee)
      - "Results not typical" disclosure where needed
      - Substantiation for objective claims
      - Clear and conspicuous disclosure placement
      Include 16 CFR Part 255 citations.

  - audit_id: emotional-design-trust.error-handling.error-message-tone
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/23-emotional-design-trust/error-handling/error-message-tone.yaml
    dimension: AGENT-READINESS
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      Assessing "emotional quality" of error messages requires subjective
      judgment about tone, blame attribution, and user emotional response.
      While LLMs can analyze tone, the audit doesn't provide scoring criteria
      or examples of good vs. bad error messages for calibration.
    recommendation: |
      Add error_message_examples section with scored examples:
      - BAD: "Invalid input" (score: 2/10 - no guidance, technical jargon)
      - GOOD: "Please enter a valid email address, like name@example.com" (score: 9/10)
      This enables consistent agent evaluation against reference points.

  # =============================================================================
  # CATEGORY 24: COMPLIANCE-GOVERNANCE
  # =============================================================================

  - audit_id: compliance-governance.data-privacy.gdpr-compliance
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/24-compliance-governance/data-privacy/gdpr-compliance.yaml
    dimension: ALIGNMENT
    severity: low
    issue: |
      GDPR compliance audit is category 24 (compliance-governance) but heavily
      overlaps with security concerns in other categories. Data breach notification
      (Article 33-34), security of processing (Article 32), and encryption
      requirements could reasonably live in security categories.
    recommendation: |
      Add cross-references in relationships section pointing to security audits
      that cover overlapping technical controls. Clarify this audit focuses on
      legal/procedural compliance while security audits cover technical implementation.

  - audit_id: compliance-governance.data-privacy.gdpr-compliance
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/24-compliance-governance/data-privacy/gdpr-compliance.yaml
    dimension: AGENT-READINESS
    severity: critical
    issue: |
      Estimated duration 8-16 hours with tier "expert". Requires "DPO interview,"
      "Legal counsel review," "Data mapping documentation review." An LLM agent
      cannot conduct legal review or assess whether a company's interpretation
      of GDPR requirements is legally sound. This is fundamentally a legal audit
      requiring qualified human judgment.
    recommendation: |
      Add explicit disclaimer: "This audit provides a structured checklist for
      GDPR compliance assessment but does not constitute legal advice. Final
      compliance determination requires qualified legal review." Mark legal
      interpretation steps as "human_required: true".

  - audit_id: compliance-governance.industry-standards.soc2-readiness
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/24-compliance-governance/industry-standards/soc2-readiness.yaml
    dimension: CLARITY
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria referenced but specific criteria (CC1-CC9,
      A1, C1, P1, PI1) not enumerated in signals. Auditors unfamiliar with
      SOC 2 cannot map findings to specific control criteria without external
      reference.
    recommendation: |
      Add trust_services_criteria section mapping each signal to specific
      SOC 2 criteria codes. Example: "STRK-HIGH-001 maps to CC6.1 (Logical
      and Physical Access Controls)."

  - audit_id: compliance-governance.industry-standards.soc2-readiness
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/24-compliance-governance/industry-standards/soc2-readiness.yaml
    dimension: AGENT-READINESS
    severity: high
    issue: |
      Estimated duration 16-40 hours. SOC 2 readiness assessment requires
      evidence collection from multiple systems (access logs, change management
      records, incident reports) and interviews with personnel. Agent cannot
      access these enterprise systems or conduct interviews.
    recommendation: |
      Restructure as evidence collection guide: specify exactly what artifacts
      humans should gather, then provide agent-executable analysis steps for
      each artifact type. Create clear handoff points between human collection
      and agent analysis phases.

  - audit_id: operational-excellence.incident-management.incident-response-process
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/25-operational-excellence/incident-management/incident-response-process.yaml
    dimension: ACTIONABILITY
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      Code patterns for incident response likely insufficient. Incident management
      often lives in external systems (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, ServiceNow) not in
      code. File patterns should target runbooks, playbooks, and IaC definitions
      for alerting infrastructure.
    recommendation: |
      Add patterns for:
      - glob: '**/runbooks/**/*.{md,yaml}'
      - glob: '**/playbooks/**/*'
      - glob: '**/*pagerduty*.{yaml,tf,json}'
      - glob: '**/*opsgenie*.{yaml,tf,json}'
      - glob: '**/alertmanager*.yaml'

  - audit_id: operational-excellence.alerting-monitoring.alert-fatigue
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/25-operational-excellence/alerting-monitoring/alert-fatigue.yaml
    dimension: AGENT-READINESS
    severity: high
    issue: |
      Alert fatigue assessment requires access to alerting system metrics:
      alert volume over time, acknowledgment rates, escalation frequency,
      time-to-acknowledge distributions. These metrics live in monitoring
      platforms (Datadog, Prometheus, PagerDuty) requiring API access an
      agent typically lacks.
    recommendation: |
      Add required_data section specifying exact metrics needed:
      - alerts_per_day_30d: Daily alert count time series
      - ack_time_p50_p99: Acknowledgment time percentiles
      - escalation_rate: Percentage of alerts escalated
      Provide sample data format so humans can export and provide to agent.

  - audit_id: operational-excellence.sre-practices.slo-definition
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/25-operational-excellence/sre-practices/slo-definition.yaml
    dimension: CLARITY
    severity: low
    issue: |
      SLO definition audit references "error budget" concept but doesn't
      explain the calculation or relationship to SLOs. Auditors unfamiliar
      with SRE practices may not understand how to assess error budget
      policies.
    recommendation: |
      Add brief explanation: "Error Budget = 100% - SLO target. A 99.9% SLO
      allows 0.1% error budget (43.8 minutes/month downtime). Assess whether
      error budget policies define actions when budget is exhausted vs.
      remaining."

  - audit_id: testing-quality-assurance.code-coverage.code-coverage
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/26-testing-quality-assurance/code-coverage/code-coverage.yaml
    dimension: ALIGNMENT
    severity: high
    issue: |
      Category 26 (testing-quality-assurance) significantly overlaps with
      Category 10 (which also covers testing). Code coverage assessment
      could reasonably exist in either category. This creates confusion
      about which category to use and potential duplicate auditing.
    recommendation: |
      Either: (a) Merge categories with clear subcategory organization, or
      (b) Define explicit boundaries: "Category 10 covers test implementation
      quality; Category 26 covers testing process and metrics." Add
      cross-references in both categories' index files.

  - audit_id: testing-quality-assurance.code-coverage.code-coverage
    file: /mnt/walnut-drive/dev/audits/audits/26-testing-quality-assurance/code-coverage/code-coverage.yaml
    dimension: CLARITY
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      Coverage thresholds mentioned but specific targets not provided.
      Statement like "insufficient coverage" lacks operational definition.
      What percentage is insufficient? Industry standards vary (70-90%
      depending on context).
    recommendation: |
      Add context-aware thresholds:
      - Critical paths: 90%+ line coverage
      - Business logic: 80%+ branch coverage
      - Utilities/helpers: 70%+ line coverage
      - Generated code: May exclude from coverage
      With justification for each threshold.

    dimension: ACTIONABILITY
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      Detecting test isolation violations requires semantic code analysis
      beyond regex patterns. Tests calling real databases, making HTTP
      requests, or accessing filesystems are violations, but patterns like
      "database|http|file" would have massive false positive rates in
      test files that properly mock these.
    recommendation: |
      Add smarter patterns targeting unmocked calls:
      - pattern: \bnew\s+(MongoClient|PgPool|MySQL)
        purpose: Direct database instantiation (should be mocked)
      - pattern: fetch\(|axios\.|http\.request\(
        purpose: Direct HTTP calls (should be mocked)
      - pattern: fs\.(read|write|unlink)
        purpose: Direct filesystem access (should be mocked)
      Combined with negative lookahead for mock/stub/spy context.

    dimension: AGENT-READINESS
    severity: high
    issue: |
      Flaky test detection requires historical test run data showing
      intermittent failures. This data lives in CI/CD systems (GitHub Actions,
      Jenkins, CircleCI) requiring API access. Static code analysis cannot
      detect actual flakiness - only patterns that might cause flakiness.
    recommendation: |
      Split audit into two phases:
      1. Static analysis: Detect flakiness-prone patterns (timing dependencies,
         shared state, race conditions) - agent executable
      2. Historical analysis: Review CI failure patterns - requires human to
         export CI data or provide API access
      Clearly mark phase 2 as requiring human data provision.

    severity: low
    issue: |
      C4 model referenced as standard but specific level requirements not
      defined. C4 has four levels (Context, Container, Component, Code).
      Audit should specify which levels are required for different system
      types/sizes.
    recommendation: |
      Add C4 level guidance:
      - All systems: Context diagram required
      - Multi-service systems: Container diagram required
      - Complex domains: Component diagrams for critical services
      - Code level: Optional, for complex algorithms only

    dimension: ACTIONABILITY
    severity: low
    issue: |
      OpenAPI linting well-suited for automation but audit doesn't specify
      which linting rules to apply. Tools like Spectral have hundreds of
      rules; audit should define required vs. recommended rule sets.
    recommendation: |
      Add linting_rules section specifying:
      - required_rules: [operation-operationId, info-contact, oas3-schema]
      - recommended_rules: [operation-description, response-examples]
      - tool_recommendation: Spectral with custom ruleset provided

    dimension: AGENT-READINESS
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      Requirements completeness assessment requires understanding domain
      context to identify missing requirements. An agent can find "TBD"
      markers and traceability gaps but cannot determine if a requirement
      set is complete for a given domain without domain knowledge.
    recommendation: |
      Reframe as "Requirements Documentation Quality" focusing on observable
      attributes: presence of TBD/TODO, traceability matrix completeness,
      requirement format consistency. Rename to avoid implying domain
      completeness assessment capability.

    dimension: CLARITY
    severity: low
    issue: |
      Given-When-Then format referenced but variations (Given-And-When-Then,
      multiple Thens) not addressed. Audit should clarify acceptable variations
      and anti-patterns (overly long scenarios, compound conditions).
    recommendation: |
      Add format_guidance section:
      - Acceptable: Single Given-When-Then per scenario
      - Acceptable: Given-And-When-Then for precondition chains
      - Anti-pattern: Multiple unrelated Thens (split into separate scenarios)
      - Anti-pattern: Scenario with 10+ steps (too complex, refactor)

    dimension: ACTIONABILITY
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      File patterns for acceptance criteria typically target Gherkin .feature
      files, but many teams store acceptance criteria in Jira, Confluence,
      or markdown files. Current patterns may miss non-Gherkin formats.
    recommendation: |
      Add diverse file patterns:
      - glob: '**/*.feature'
        purpose: Gherkin/Cucumber feature files
      - glob: '**/acceptance/**/*.md'
        purpose: Markdown acceptance criteria
      - glob: '**/specs/**/*.md'
        purpose: Specification documents
      - glob: '**/stories/**/*.{yaml,json}'
        purpose: User story definitions

  - audit_id: CROSS-CATEGORY
    file: Multiple files in categories 22-28
    dimension: ACTIONABILITY
    severity: high
    issue: |
      Generic code patterns repeated across 35+ gamification audits:
      "gamif|reward|achievement|badge|point|level" and "notification|push|alert|reminder".
      These patterns will match identical files for every gamification audit,
      providing no differentiation. An audit on streak mechanisms shouldn't
      surface achievement code; a leaderboard audit shouldn't surface notification
      code unless leaderboard-notification specific.
    recommendation: |
      Create pattern library with audit-specific patterns. Each audit should
      have unique primary patterns that surface code specific to that audit's
      concerns. Generic patterns can remain as secondary/supplemental patterns
      but should not be the primary discovery mechanism.

  - audit_id: CROSS-CATEGORY
    file: Multiple files in categories 22-28
    dimension: AGENT-READINESS
    severity: high
    issue: |
      21 of 31 audits sampled require stakeholder interviews (30-90 minutes
      each). Audits marked "automatable: partial" or "automatable: manual"
      but interview requirements not factored into automation assessment.
      An agent cannot conduct interviews, making these audits human-dependent
      regardless of other automation potential.
    recommendation: |
      Add explicit field "requires_interviews: true/false" distinct from
      "automatable" field. Create agent execution modes:
      - full: Agent can complete end-to-end
      - artifact_analysis: Agent can analyze provided artifacts
      - preparation_only: Agent can prepare but human executes
      - synthesis_only: Agent can synthesize human-gathered data

  - audit_id: CROSS-CATEGORY
    file: Multiple files in categories 24, 25, 26
    dimension: ALIGNMENT
    severity: medium
    issue: |
      Compliance (24), Operations (25), and Testing (26) audits have unclear
      boundaries. SOC 2 readiness (24) covers operational controls that
      overlap with incident management (25). Testing quality (26) overlaps
      with quality assurance aspects of SOC 2 (24). Category boundaries
      appear organizational rather than conceptual.
    recommendation: |
      Create category relationship map documenting overlaps and guidance
      for when to use which category. Add to category index files:
      "Use this category when primary concern is X. For Y concerns, see
      category Z instead."

  - audit_id: CROSS-CATEGORY
    file: All files in category 22
    dimension: ALIGNMENT
    severity: low
    issue: |
      All gamification audits marked tier "phd" but cognitive complexity
      varies significantly. Achievement display audit requires less expertise
      than compulsion loop assessment. Uniform tier assignment doesn't reflect
      actual complexity differences.
    recommendation: |
      Re-evaluate tier assignments based on:
      - Expert: Requires domain expertise but established frameworks
      - PhD: Requires novel judgment, ethical reasoning, or research synthesis
      Achievement display, badge design = expert tier
      Compulsion loops, habit ethics = phd tier (legitimate)

summary:
  total_findings: 32
  by_dimension:
    CLARITY: 10
    ALIGNMENT: 5
    AGENT-READINESS: 12
    ACTIONABILITY: 5
  by_severity:
    critical: 2
    high: 10
    medium: 14
    low: 6
  key_themes:
    - Generic code patterns provide no audit-specific value across gamification category
    - Interview requirements make most audits non-automatable regardless of other factors
    - Philosophical/ethical judgments in signals lack operational definitions
    - Category boundaries unclear, especially between testing categories (10 vs 26)
    - External system access requirements (monitoring, CI/CD, support ticketing) not addressed

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - Create audit-specific code patterns for all gamification audits
    - Add "requires_interviews" field distinct from "automatable"
    - Document category 10 vs 26 boundaries and merge if appropriate
  short_term:
    - Add operational definitions for ethical judgments (persuasion vs coercion)
    - Create agent execution mode taxonomy (full/artifact/preparation/synthesis)
    - Add external system access requirements documentation
  long_term:
    - Develop pattern library with semantic tagging
    - Create category relationship map
    - Implement tier calibration based on cognitive complexity assessment
