description:
  what: |
    Evaluates processes and tools for managing timing budgets throughout the
    development lifecycle. Reviews how timing requirements are allocated to
    subsystems and functions, tracked during development, and verified before
    release. Assesses margin management, change control, and integration with
    continuous integration pipelines.
  why_it_matters: |
    Timing budgets prevent individual components from consuming excessive
    processor time at the expense of others. Without budget management,
    integration often reveals timing problems late when fixes are expensive.
    Proactive budget tracking catches overruns early and ensures balanced
    allocation across the system.
  when_to_run:
  - At project inception
  - During architecture design
  - At integration milestones
  - Before major releases
  - After significant changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TBM-CRIT-001
    signal: Timing budget exceeded with no recovery plan
    evidence_indicators:
    - Measured time exceeds budget by >20%
    - No optimization opportunities identified
    - Budget overrun affects system feasibility
    explanation: |
      Unrecoverable budget overruns threaten system viability. Without
      a plan to reduce timing, the project may be unable to meet
      requirements.
    remediation: Identify optimization or redesign options immediately
  - id: TBM-CRIT-002
    signal: No timing budget allocation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - Timing requirements not decomposed
    - No per-component budgets defined
    - Ad-hoc timing management
    explanation: |
      Without budget allocation, timing problems are discovered at
      integration when they are most expensive to fix.
    remediation: Establish timing budget allocation process
  high:
  - id: TBM-HIGH-001
    signal: Timing budget tracking not performed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Budget not monitored during development
    - No regular timing reviews
    - Stale budget data
    explanation: |
      Without continuous tracking, budget creep goes unnoticed until
      it becomes a major problem. Early detection enables timely action.
    remediation: Implement regular timing budget reviews
  - id: TBM-HIGH-002
    signal: Budget margin insufficient for risk
    evidence_indicators:
    - Margin under 20%
    - No contingency allocation
    - All budgets fully consumed
    explanation: |
      Insufficient margin leaves no room for inevitable timing growth
      during development and integration.
    remediation: Maintain adequate margin in budget allocations
  medium:
  - id: TBM-MED-001
    signal: Timing budget changes not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No change history maintained
    - Budget adjustments undocumented
    - Rationale for changes missing
    explanation: |
      Without change tracking, it is impossible to understand timing
      trends and make informed decisions about future allocations.
    remediation: Implement timing budget change control
  - id: TBM-MED-002
    signal: Timing not integrated in CI pipeline
    evidence_indicators:
    - No automated timing regression
    - Budget violations not flagged
    - Manual timing verification only
    explanation: |
      Without CI integration, timing regressions may go undetected
      for extended periods.
    remediation: Add timing budget checks to CI pipeline
  low:
  - id: TBM-LOW-001
    signal: Timing budget documentation incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - Budget assumptions not documented
    - Allocation rationale missing
    - Traceability to requirements unclear
    explanation: |
      Complete documentation supports maintenance and enables
      informed decision-making for future changes.
    remediation: Document timing budget methodology and rationale
  positive:
  - id: TBM-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive timing budget management process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear budget allocations
    - Regular tracking and reviews
    - Adequate margins maintained
  - id: TBM-POS-002
    signal: Automated timing regression in CI
    evidence_indicators:
    - Every build checks timing
    - Budget violations flagged immediately
    - Historical trends tracked
