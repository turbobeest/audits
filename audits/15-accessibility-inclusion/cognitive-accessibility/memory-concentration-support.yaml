  what: |
    This audit evaluates support for users with memory difficulties and
    concentration challenges, including those with ADHD, age-related memory
    decline, acquired brain injuries, or other cognitive conditions.

    Based on COGA (Cognitive Accessibility) guidelines, the audit examines:
    - Short-term memory support (visible context, progress indicators)
    - Working memory support (chunked information, task breakdowns)
    - Long-term memory support (familiar patterns, help when needed)
    - Concentration support (focus modes, minimal distractions)
    - Multi-step process support (progress tracking, save states)
    - Time pressure reduction (adequate time, extensions)
    - Context preservation (breadcrumbs, history)
    - Reminder and notification systems
  why_it_matters: |
    Memory and concentration difficulties affect many user groups:
    - ADHD affects 4-5% of adults
    - Age-related cognitive decline affects millions of older adults
    - Traumatic brain injury survivors
    - People experiencing stress, fatigue, or multitasking
    - Those with certain medical conditions or medications

    Without support, these users may:
    - Lose track of where they are in a process
    - Forget information they need to complete tasks
    - Miss important steps in multi-step processes
    - Abandon tasks due to frustration or confusion
    - Make errors when distracted or under time pressure
  when_to_run:
  - When designing multi-step flows
  - For applications targeting older adults
  - During accessibility audits
  - When users report confusion or task abandonment

signals:
  critical:
  - id: A11Y-MEM-CRIT-001
    signal: Session expires without warning during tasks
    evidence_indicators:
    - Form data lost due to timeout
    - Shopping cart cleared without notice
    - No warning before session expiration
    explanation: |
      Users who take longer due to memory or concentration difficulties
      may lose significant work to session timeouts, causing frustration
      and potentially preventing task completion entirely.
    remediation: |
      Implement timeout handling:
      - Warn users before session expires (at least 20 seconds before)
      - Allow extension of session time
      - Auto-save form progress
      - Consider longer timeouts for accessibility
  - id: A11Y-MEM-CRIT-002
    signal: Multi-step process has no progress indication
    evidence_indicators:
    - No step counter or progress bar
    - No way to see completed steps
    - Users cannot tell how much remains
    explanation: |
      Without progress indication, users with memory difficulties cannot
      track where they are in a process, leading to confusion, repeated
      steps, or abandonment.
    remediation: |
      Add clear progress indication:
      - Step counter (Step 2 of 5)
      - Progress bar with percentage
      - List of steps with current position
      - Ability to review completed steps
  high:
  - id: A11Y-MEM-HIGH-001
    signal: Information needed is not visible when needed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Must remember choices from previous screens
    - Reference information not accessible during input
    - Instructions disappear before task is complete
    explanation: |
      Requiring users to remember information from one screen while working
      on another creates excessive memory load.
    remediation: |
      Keep necessary information visible:
      - Show summary of selections throughout process
      - Keep instructions visible during task
      - Provide access to reference information from all screens
      - Use sidebars or persistent elements for context
  - id: A11Y-MEM-HIGH-002
    signal: Complex tasks not broken into steps
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long forms without sections
    - Many decisions required at once
    - No task breakdown or chunking
    explanation: |
      Complex tasks presented as single large units overwhelm working
      memory and concentration capacity.
    remediation: |
      Break tasks into manageable steps:
      - Chunk long forms into sections
      - One major decision per screen when possible
      - Group related fields together
      - Allow saving progress between sections
  - id: A11Y-MEM-HIGH-003
    signal: No breadcrumb or location indication
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users cannot tell where they are in site
    - No navigation context
    - Hard to return to previous locations
    explanation: |
      Without location indicators, users with memory difficulties may
      forget how they got to the current page or how to return to
      previous locations.
    remediation: |
      Provide navigation context:
      - Breadcrumb navigation
      - Current section highlighting
      - Recent history accessible
      - Clear page titles indicating location
  medium:
  - id: A11Y-MEM-MED-001
    signal: No save or resume capability
    evidence_indicators:
    - Must complete process in one session
    - No draft saving
    - Cannot continue later
    explanation: |
      Users who need breaks due to concentration difficulties or who are
      interrupted cannot return to complete tasks.
    remediation: |
      Implement save and resume:
      - Auto-save progress
      - "Save for later" option
      - Email/link to continue
      - Store progress in account if logged in
  - id: A11Y-MEM-MED-002
    signal: Heavy reliance on recall rather than recognition
    evidence_indicators:
    - Must type remembered values
    - No autocomplete or suggestions
    - No recently used items
    explanation: |
      Requiring users to recall information from memory (type a code,
      remember a name) is harder than recognizing from options.
    remediation: |
      Favor recognition over recall:
      - Provide autocomplete
      - Show recent/frequent choices
      - Use selection instead of text entry when possible
      - Provide examples and hints
  - id: A11Y-MEM-MED-003
    signal: Time pressure on tasks
    evidence_indicators:
    - Countdown timers during tasks
    - Must complete quickly to succeed
    - Time-limited access to content
    explanation: |
      Time pressure increases cognitive load and disadvantages users who
      process information more slowly.
    remediation: |
      Reduce time pressure:
      - Remove unnecessary time limits
      - Allow pausing of timed activities
      - Provide extended time options
      - Don't make time limit central to experience
  low:
  - id: A11Y-MEM-LOW-001
    signal: Minor memory support enhancements possible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Could have more progress indicators
    - Could surface more context
    explanation: |
      Memory support exists but could be enhanced for better experience.
    remediation: |
      Enhance based on user research and feedback.
