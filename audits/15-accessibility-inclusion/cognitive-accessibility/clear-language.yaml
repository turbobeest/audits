  what: |
    This audit evaluates content clarity and plain language usage to ensure
    users with cognitive disabilities can understand and use the application.
    Based on WCAG 3.1 (Readable) guidelines and COGA (Cognitive Accessibility)
    task force recommendations.

    The audit examines:
    - Reading level appropriateness for target audience
    - Use of clear, simple sentence structures
    - Avoidance of jargon and technical terms without explanation
    - Consistent terminology throughout the application
    - Clear and descriptive link text
    - Helpful and actionable error messages
    - Instructions that are easy to follow
    - Definitions for unusual words or abbreviations
  why_it_matters: |
    Cognitive disabilities affect a significant portion of the population:
    - Learning disabilities (dyslexia, dyscalculia)
    - Attention disorders (ADHD)
    - Memory impairments
    - Intellectual disabilities
    - Autism spectrum differences
    - Age-related cognitive decline

    Complex language creates barriers for these users:
    - Prevents understanding of instructions and content
    - Increases errors during form completion
    - Causes frustration and abandonment
    - Excludes users from accessing services

    Clear language benefits everyone, including non-native speakers and
    users under stress or time pressure.
  when_to_run:
  - During content development
  - After major content updates
  - For accessibility compliance reviews
  - When user comprehension issues are reported

signals:
  critical:
  - id: A11Y-LANG-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical instructions incomprehensible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Safety or legal information in complex language
    - Essential instructions require expert reading level
    - Error messages don't explain what went wrong
    explanation: |
      Essential instructions or error messages are written at a level
      that prevents many users from understanding them, potentially
      causing harm or preventing task completion.
    remediation: |
      Rewrite critical content using plain language:
      - Use simple, common words
      - Write short sentences (15-20 words max)
      - Use active voice
      - Test with reading level tools (aim for grade 8 or lower)
  high:
  - id: A11Y-LANG-HIGH-001
    signal: Jargon used without explanation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Technical terms without definitions
    - Industry-specific vocabulary assumed
    - Acronyms used without expansion
    explanation: |
      Domain-specific or technical terminology is used without explanation,
      excluding users unfamiliar with the jargon.
    remediation: |
      Define technical terms on first use. Use tooltips or glossary links.
      Consider whether jargon can be replaced with plain language.
      Expand acronyms on first use: "URL (web address)".
  - id: A11Y-LANG-HIGH-002
    signal: Error messages not actionable
    evidence_indicators:
    - 'Generic errors: ''Something went wrong'''
    - Technical error codes without explanation
    - Errors don't indicate how to fix the problem
    explanation: |
      Error messages fail to explain what went wrong or how to fix it,
      leaving users stuck and frustrated.
    remediation: |
      Write error messages that:
      1. State what happened in plain language
      2. Explain why (if relevant)
      3. Tell user how to fix it
      Example: "Password must be at least 8 characters. Add 2 more characters."
  medium:
  - id: A11Y-LANG-MED-001
    signal: Reading level too high for general audience
    evidence_indicators:
    - Average sentence length over 20 words
    - Grade level above 10 for consumer content
    - Multiple complex sentences per paragraph
    explanation: |
      Content written at a reading level higher than appropriate for
      the target audience, reducing comprehension for many users.
    remediation: |
      Simplify content:
      - Aim for grade 8 reading level for general audiences
      - Break long sentences into shorter ones
      - Use common words instead of complex alternatives
      - One idea per paragraph
  - id: A11Y-LANG-MED-002
    signal: Inconsistent terminology
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same concept called different names in different places
    - Button labels vary for same action
    - Mixed terminology in instructions
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent use of terms confuses users who cannot be certain
      whether different words refer to the same or different things.
    remediation: |
      Create and follow a terminology guide:
      - Choose one term for each concept
      - Use consistently throughout
      - Document in style guide
      - Use content linting to enforce
  low:
  - id: A11Y-LANG-LOW-001
    signal: Minor clarity improvements possible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some sentences could be simpler
    - Occasional jargon in non-critical content
    explanation: |
      Content is generally understandable but could benefit from
      clarity improvements.
    remediation: |
      Review and simplify during regular content updates.
  positive:
  - id: A11Y-LANG-POS-001
    signal: Excellent plain language implementation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Grade 8 or lower reading level
    - Consistent terminology
    - Clear, actionable error messages
  - id: A11Y-LANG-POS-002
    signal: Glossary or help provided for technical terms
    evidence_indicators:
    - Terms linked to definitions
    - Tooltips explain jargon
    - Help documentation in plain language
