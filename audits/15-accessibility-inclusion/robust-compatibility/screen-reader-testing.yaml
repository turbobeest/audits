  what: |
    This audit conducts comprehensive testing with multiple screen reader
    technologies to verify application accessibility. Screen readers are
    the primary assistive technology for blind and low-vision users.

    Testing covers:
    - NVDA (Windows, free) - most popular free screen reader
    - JAWS (Windows, commercial) - industry standard, enterprise use
    - VoiceOver (macOS/iOS) - native Apple screen reader
    - TalkBack (Android) - native Android screen reader
    - Narrator (Windows) - built-in Windows screen reader

    For each screen reader, the audit verifies:
    - Page navigation and orientation
    - Content reading and comprehension
    - Form completion and submission
    - Interactive widget operation
    - Error handling and recovery
    - Dynamic content announcements
  why_it_matters: |
    Screen reader testing is essential because:
    - Automated tools catch only 30-40% of accessibility issues
    - Different screen readers interpret markup differently
    - Real user experience can only be verified through testing
    - Browser and AT combinations have varying behaviors
    - Dynamic content often fails silently in automated tests

    Without screen reader testing, critical accessibility issues may
    go undetected, creating barriers for blind users who depend on
    these technologies for all computer interaction.
  when_to_run:
  - Before major releases
  - After significant UI changes
  - When adding new interactive features
  - For accessibility compliance certification

signals:
  critical:
  - id: A11Y-SR-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical functionality inaccessible with screen reader
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot complete primary user tasks
    - Key features not announced or reachable
    - Forms cannot be completed
    explanation: |
      Users relying on screen readers cannot complete essential tasks
      that the application is designed for. This represents a fundamental
      accessibility barrier.
    remediation: |
      Identify specific blocking issues and remediate:
      - Add missing accessible names
      - Fix ARIA implementation
      - Ensure keyboard accessibility
      - Add proper focus management
  - id: A11Y-SR-CRIT-002
    signal: Screen reader announces misleading information
    evidence_indicators:
    - Incorrect roles announced
    - Wrong accessible names
    - Confusing or contradictory announcements
    explanation: |
      Screen reader provides incorrect information about content or
      controls, potentially leading users to take wrong actions or
      misunderstand content.
    remediation: |
      Review ARIA usage and accessible names. Ensure roles match actual
      functionality. Test with multiple screen readers to verify
      announcements.
  high:
  - id: A11Y-SR-HIGH-001
    signal: Major navigation issues with screen reader
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot efficiently navigate by landmarks
    - Heading structure confusing or missing
    - Tab order illogical
    explanation: |
      Screen reader users cannot efficiently navigate the page structure,
      forcing them to read through all content sequentially rather than
      navigating directly to sections.
    remediation: |
      Add proper landmark regions, implement logical heading hierarchy,
      and ensure tab order follows visual reading order.
  - id: A11Y-SR-HIGH-002
    signal: Dynamic content not announced
    evidence_indicators:
    - AJAX updates not announced
    - Status messages silent
    - Validation errors not conveyed
    explanation: |
      Dynamic content changes occur without screen reader announcement,
      leaving users unaware of important updates or errors.
    remediation: |
      Implement ARIA live regions for dynamic content. Use appropriate
      politeness levels. Ensure focus management for significant changes.
  - id: A11Y-SR-HIGH-003
    signal: Screen reader behavior differs significantly between AT
    evidence_indicators:
    - Works in NVDA but fails in JAWS
    - VoiceOver announces differently than Windows readers
    - Mobile screen readers have issues desktop doesn't
    explanation: |
      Significant functionality differences between screen readers indicate
      reliance on non-standard behavior or poor cross-AT compatibility.
    remediation: |
      Use well-supported ARIA patterns from APG. Test with multiple screen
      readers. Avoid relying on AT-specific behaviors.
  medium:
  - id: A11Y-SR-MED-001
    signal: Verbose or repetitive announcements
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same information announced multiple times
    - Excessive detail slows navigation
    - Redundant accessible names
    explanation: |
      Screen reader announces more information than necessary, making
      the experience tedious and inefficient.
    remediation: |
      Remove redundant aria-labels. Use aria-hidden on decorative content.
      Optimize announcements for efficiency.
  - id: A11Y-SR-MED-002
    signal: Minor usability issues with screen reader
    evidence_indicators:
    - Suboptimal reading order in some areas
    - Minor focus management issues
    - Some controls harder to use than necessary
    explanation: |
      While functional, some areas are more difficult to use with screen
      readers than they need to be.
    remediation: |
      Refine implementation for better screen reader experience. Consider
      user feedback from actual screen reader users.
  low:
  - id: A11Y-SR-LOW-001
    signal: Minor announcement inconsistencies
    evidence_indicators:
    - Slightly different announcements between screen readers
    - Non-critical content differences
    explanation: |
      Minor differences in announcements between screen readers that don't
      significantly impact usability.
    remediation: |
      Document known differences. Prioritize fixes for major screen
      readers based on user demographics.
