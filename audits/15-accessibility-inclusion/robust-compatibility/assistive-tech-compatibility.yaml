  what: |
    This audit verifies application compatibility with a broad range of
    assistive technologies beyond screen readers. WCAG's Robust principle
    (Guideline 4) requires content to be compatible with current and future
    user agents, including assistive technologies.

    Testing covers:
    - Screen magnification software (ZoomText, Windows Magnifier)
    - Voice control systems (Dragon NaturallySpeaking, Voice Control)
    - Switch access devices
    - Alternative keyboards and input devices
    - Eye tracking systems
    - Refreshable braille displays
    - Reading software and text-to-speech

    The audit verifies:
    - Content remains usable when magnified
    - Voice commands can activate controls
    - Focus is visible and manageable
    - Timing is not restrictive
    - Input method independence
  why_it_matters: |
    Different disabilities require different assistive technologies:
    - Low vision users need magnification and high contrast
    - Motor impairments require voice control, switches, or alternative inputs
    - Learning disabilities benefit from text-to-speech
    - Deafblind users need braille display support

    An application may work well with screen readers but fail with other
    assistive technologies. Comprehensive AT compatibility ensures the
    widest possible user access.
  when_to_run:
  - Before accessibility certification
  - After major interface redesigns
  - When adding new input methods
  - For comprehensive accessibility audits

signals:
  critical:
  - id: A11Y-AT-CRIT-001
    signal: Voice control cannot activate critical controls
    evidence_indicators:
    - Buttons without visible text cannot be voice-selected
    - Voice commands not recognized for primary actions
    - Ambiguous or missing speakable labels
    explanation: |
      Users relying on voice control cannot execute essential application
      functions. Voice control typically works by speaking visible text
      or assigned numbers.
    remediation: |
      Ensure all controls have visible text labels or provide voice control
      compatible accessible names. Test with Dragon NaturallySpeaking or
      macOS Voice Control to verify speakability.
  - id: A11Y-AT-CRIT-002
    signal: Application unusable with screen magnification
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical content scrolls out of view
    - Popups/tooltips appear far from triggering element
    - Focus lost when magnified
    - Essential content cut off at high magnification
    explanation: |
      Users with low vision who rely on magnification cannot effectively
      use the application. At 200-400% zoom, they see only a small portion
      of the screen at once.
    remediation: |
      Ensure focus indicators are visible at all zoom levels. Keep related
      content close together. Ensure popups appear near their triggers.
      Use reflow-friendly layouts.
  high:
  - id: A11Y-AT-HIGH-001
    signal: Switch access users cannot reach all controls
    evidence_indicators:
    - Focus order skips important controls
    - Custom controls not focusable
    - Focus gets trapped in components
    explanation: |
      Switch users navigate sequentially using one or two switches. If
      controls cannot receive focus or are skipped, they're inaccessible.
    remediation: |
      Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard focusable. Implement
      logical focus order. Avoid focus traps. Test with iOS/macOS Switch
      Control.
  - id: A11Y-AT-HIGH-002
    signal: Alternative keyboard users face barriers
    evidence_indicators:
    - Shortcuts conflict with AT commands
    - Keyboard-only operation not possible
    - Modifier keys required for essential functions
    explanation: |
      Users of alternative keyboards, on-screen keyboards, or single-handed
      keyboards cannot access functions requiring specific key combinations.
    remediation: |
      Avoid required use of modifier key combinations. Provide alternative
      methods for all functions. Don't override standard keyboard shortcuts.
  - id: A11Y-AT-HIGH-003
    signal: Time limits not adjustable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Session timeouts cannot be extended
    - Time-limited operations have no pause
    - Moving content cannot be stopped
    explanation: |
      Users of many assistive technologies work more slowly. Fixed time
      limits may cause them to lose work or be unable to complete tasks.
    remediation: |
      Per WCAG 2.2.1, allow users to turn off, adjust, or extend time limits.
      Provide pause, stop, hide for moving content.
  medium:
  - id: A11Y-AT-MED-001
    signal: Text-to-speech reads content poorly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Abbreviations not expanded
    - Unusual pronunciations
    - Reading order confusing
    explanation: |
      Users who rely on text-to-speech (distinct from screen readers)
      for reading assistance receive poor quality audio output.
    remediation: |
      Use proper HTML semantics. Consider adding pronunciation hints via
      SSML or aria-label for ambiguous text. Ensure logical reading order.
  - id: A11Y-AT-MED-002
    signal: High contrast mode breaks design
    evidence_indicators:
    - Content becomes invisible in high contrast
    - Icons disappear
    - Focus indicators invisible
    explanation: |
      Users with low vision using Windows High Contrast mode or similar
      cannot see some content or UI elements.
    remediation: |
      Test with Windows High Contrast mode. Use CSS that respects forced
      colors. Ensure icons have proper contrast or use system colors.
  low:
  - id: A11Y-AT-LOW-001
    signal: Minor usability issues with specific AT
    evidence_indicators:
    - Suboptimal but functional behavior
    - Extra steps needed for some AT users
    explanation: |
      Some assistive technology users encounter minor inconveniences that
      don't prevent task completion.
    remediation: |
      Document issues and prioritize based on frequency and impact.
  positive:
  - id: A11Y-AT-POS-001
    signal: Application works across diverse AT
    evidence_indicators:

    - Input method independent
    - Flexible timing
  - id: A11Y-AT-POS-002
    signal: Proactive AT compatibility features
