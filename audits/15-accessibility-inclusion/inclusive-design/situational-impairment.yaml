  what: |
    This audit evaluates how well the application supports users experiencing
    situational or temporary impairments. Unlike permanent disabilities,
    situational impairments affect users temporarily based on their context
    or circumstances.

    Common situational impairments include:
    - Visual: Bright sunlight, dirty glasses, tired eyes
    - Auditory: Noisy environments, quiet settings where sound is inappropriate
    - Motor: Holding a baby, injured arm, wearing gloves
    - Cognitive: Distracted by children, stressed, multitasking

    The audit examines:
    - One-handed operation capability
    - Glare and outdoor visibility
    - Audio alternatives for silent contexts
    - Large touch targets for imprecise input
    - Reduced attention/distraction scenarios
    - Temporary mobility limitations
    - Environmental lighting variations
  why_it_matters: |
    Situational impairments affect everyone at some point:
    - A parent holding a child uses their phone one-handed
    - A commuter in a noisy train cannot hear audio
    - Someone in bright sunlight struggles to see screens
    - A busy professional is distracted while trying to complete tasks

    Designing for situational impairments:
    - Improves experience for 100% of users at various times
    - Often benefits users with permanent disabilities
    - Increases overall usability and satisfaction
    - Represents inclusive design best practices
  when_to_run:
  - During mobile application development
  - When designing for diverse use contexts
  - For consumer-facing applications
  - When evaluating field/outdoor use cases

signals:
  critical:
  - id: A11Y-SIT-CRIT-001
    signal: Application unusable with one hand
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical controls only in corners
    - Two-hand gestures required for basic tasks
    - No accommodation for one-handed use
    explanation: |
      Many users hold phones one-handed while holding something else,
      having an injured hand, or simply preferring one-handed operation.
      If basic tasks require two hands, users are excluded.
    remediation: |
      Design for one-handed use:
      - Place critical controls in thumb-reach zone
      - Avoid gestures requiring two hands
      - Provide one-handed alternatives for complex gestures
      - Consider bottom-sheet navigation for mobile
  - id: A11Y-SIT-CRIT-002
    signal: No alternative for audio-only information
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical alerts only via sound
    - Audio content without captions
    - Sound required to understand content
    explanation: |
      Users in noisy environments or situations where sound is inappropriate
      (meetings, libraries) cannot perceive audio-only information.
    remediation: |
      Provide visual alternatives:
      - Visual indicators for all audio alerts
      - Captions for video content
      - Text alternatives for audio content
      - Vibration patterns where appropriate
  high:
  - id: A11Y-SIT-HIGH-001
    signal: Low contrast unusable in bright conditions
    evidence_indicators:
    - Light grays on white backgrounds
    - Contrast below 4.5:1 for text
    - No high contrast option
    explanation: |
      In bright outdoor conditions, even users with perfect vision struggle
      with low contrast. This becomes a significant barrier for outdoor or
      mobile use.
    remediation: |
      Ensure adequate contrast:
      - Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
      - Consider higher contrast for mobile interfaces
      - Support prefers-contrast: more media query
      - Test in bright conditions
  - id: A11Y-SIT-HIGH-002
    signal: Touch targets too small for imprecise input
    evidence_indicators:
    - Touch targets smaller than 44x44px
    - Close-together targets without spacing
    - Precision required for basic interaction
    explanation: |
      Users with cold hands, wearing gloves, holding things, or simply
      having larger fingers struggle with small touch targets. This is
      especially problematic for mobile use.
    remediation: |
      Size touch targets appropriately:
      - Minimum 44x44px touch targets
      - Adequate spacing between targets (8px minimum)
      - Larger targets for frequent/important actions
      - Consider seasonal/context of use
  medium:
  - id: A11Y-SIT-MED-001
    signal: Complex interactions require sustained attention
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long forms without save progress
    - Time-sensitive interactions
    - No support for interrupted tasks
    explanation: |
      Users multitasking or being interrupted (by children, work, etc.)
      cannot sustain attention for extended interactions.
    remediation: |
      Support interrupted use:
      - Auto-save form progress
      - Allow resuming incomplete tasks
      - Remove unnecessary time limits
      - Chunk complex tasks into steps
  - id: A11Y-SIT-MED-002
    signal: Gestures require precision
    evidence_indicators:
    - Small swipe targets
    - Precise pinch-zoom required
    - Edge swipes from thin margins
    explanation: |
      Precise gestures are difficult when users are in motion (walking,
      riding), have imprecise input (gloves, wet fingers), or have
      momentary limitations.
    remediation: |
      Provide gesture alternatives:
      - Button alternatives for swipe actions
      - Larger gesture areas
      - Tap alternatives for complex gestures
      - Undo for accidental gestures
  low:
  - id: A11Y-SIT-LOW-001
    signal: Minor situational optimizations possible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Could better support edge cases
    - Some contexts less well supported
    explanation: |
      Application generally handles situational impairments but could
      be enhanced for specific contexts.
    remediation: |
      Gather feedback from users in varied contexts.

  - id: A11Y-SIT-POS-001
    signal: Excellent situational impairment support
    evidence_indicators:
    - One-handed operation fully supported
    - Visual alternatives for audio
    - High contrast in all conditions
  - id: A11Y-SIT-POS-002
    signal: Context-adaptive design
    evidence_indicators:
    - Adapts to device capabilities
    - Respects user preferences
    - Works in varied conditions
