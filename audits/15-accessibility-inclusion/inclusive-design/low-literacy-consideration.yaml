  what: |
    This audit evaluates how well the application supports users with
    limited literacy skills, including those with low reading levels,
    dyslexia, or limited formal education.

    Low literacy considerations include:
    - Reading level of content (aim for grade 6-8)
    - Use of visual communication (icons, images)
    - Reduction of text-heavy interfaces
    - Clear, simple instructions
    - Avoidance of jargon and complex vocabulary
    - Support for alternative input methods
    - Audio and video alternatives

    The audit examines:
    - Content readability level
    - Visual communication effectiveness
    - Form and input simplicity
    - Error message clarity
    - Support for voice input
    - Multimodal content delivery
  why_it_matters: |
    Low literacy affects more people than commonly assumed:
    - 21% of US adults read at or below 5th grade level
    - 54% of US adults read below 6th grade level
    - Dyslexia affects 5-10% of the population
    - Many users read in a second language

    Designing for low literacy:
    - Makes content accessible to millions of excluded users
    - Improves comprehension for all users
    - Reduces errors and support needs
    - Enables broader market reach
    - Aligns with plain language requirements for government
  when_to_run:
  - For public-facing applications
  - For healthcare and government services
  - When targeting diverse populations
  - When plain language is required

signals:
  critical:
  - id: A11Y-LIT-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical content requires high reading level
    evidence_indicators:
    - Essential instructions above grade 10
    - Error messages use complex language
    - Legal/safety content not simplified
    explanation: |
      When essential content requires high literacy, users with limited
      reading skills cannot access critical information or complete
      necessary tasks.
    remediation: |
      Simplify critical content:
      - Aim for grade 6-8 reading level
      - Use short sentences (15-20 words max)
      - Choose common words over complex ones
      - Test with readability tools
  - id: A11Y-LIT-CRIT-002
    signal: No visual communication for key concepts
    evidence_indicators:
    - Text-only instructions for complex processes
    - No icons or images to support understanding
    - Reliance on text comprehension alone
    explanation: |
      Users with limited literacy rely heavily on visual communication.
      Text-only interfaces exclude these users and make content less
      accessible globally.
    remediation: |
      Add visual communication:
      - Icons for common actions
      - Images/diagrams for complex concepts
      - Video explanations where helpful
      - Visual progress indicators
  high:
  - id: A11Y-LIT-HIGH-001
    signal: Forms require complex text entry
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long text fields without alternatives
    - Complex formatting required
    - No selection-based alternatives
    explanation: |
      Extended text entry is challenging for low-literacy users. Typing
      requires spelling and composition skills that may be limited.
    remediation: |
      Reduce text entry requirements:
      - Use dropdowns/selection where possible
      - Provide autocomplete
      - Allow voice input
      - Keep required text minimal
  - id: A11Y-LIT-HIGH-002
    signal: Jargon and technical terms without explanation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Industry-specific terminology
    - Acronyms without expansion
    - No glossary or definitions
    explanation: |
      Technical jargon excludes users unfamiliar with specialized vocabulary,
      compounding literacy challenges.
    remediation: |
      Define or avoid jargon:
      - Use plain language alternatives
      - Expand acronyms on first use
      - Provide tooltips or glossary
      - Consider audience vocabulary
  - id: A11Y-LIT-HIGH-003
    signal: Dense text blocks without structure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long paragraphs of unbroken text
    - No headings or bullet points
    - Walls of text
    explanation: |
      Dense text is overwhelming for low-literacy users and makes finding
      specific information difficult.
    remediation: |
      Structure content for scanning:
      - Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences)
      - Bullet points for lists
      - Descriptive headings
      - White space between sections
  medium:
  - id: A11Y-LIT-MED-001
    signal: No audio/video alternatives
    evidence_indicators:
    - Complex content text-only
    - Instructions without video option
    - No text-to-speech integration
    explanation: |
      Audio and video provide alternative access to content for users who
      struggle with reading.
    remediation: |
      Provide multimedia alternatives:
      - Video tutorials for complex processes
      - Audio versions of important content
      - Text-to-speech capability
      - Ensure multimedia is also captioned
  - id: A11Y-LIT-MED-002
    signal: Error messages unclear for low-literacy users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Technical error explanations
    - Complex instructions for correction
    - No visual indication of error location
    explanation: |
      Complex error messages compound frustration for users already
      struggling with the interface.
    remediation: |
      Simplify error communication:
      - Plain language error messages
      - Visual indication of error location
      - Simple, specific correction steps
      - Examples of valid input
  low:
  - id: A11Y-LIT-LOW-001
    signal: Minor readability optimizations possible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some content above target level
    - Could be more visual
    explanation: |
      Content is generally accessible but could be simplified further.
    remediation: |
      Continue readability improvements in content updates.
