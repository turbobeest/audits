  what: |
    This audit evaluates how well the application supports older adults
    (typically 65+) who may experience age-related changes in vision,
    hearing, motor control, and cognition.

    Age-related changes include:
    - Vision: Reduced contrast sensitivity, presbyopia, color perception changes
    - Hearing: High-frequency hearing loss, difficulty with speech discrimination
    - Motor: Reduced fine motor control, slower reaction times, tremor
    - Cognition: Slower processing, working memory changes, learning curve

    The audit examines:
    - Text size and readability
    - Contrast and color usage
    - Touch/click target sizes
    - Timing and pace of interactions
    - Complexity and learning requirements
    - Error tolerance and recovery
    - Familiarity of patterns
    - Support for adaptive technologies
  why_it_matters: |
    The global population is aging:
    - By 2050, 2.1 billion people will be over 60
    - Older adults are increasingly digital but often underserved
    - Age-related changes are gradual and universal
    - Many older adults don't identify as "disabled"

    Designing for aging users:
    - Serves a large and growing population
    - Benefits users of all ages (larger text helps everyone)
    - Addresses the continuum between ability and disability
    - Represents sustainable inclusive design
  when_to_run:
  - For applications targeting general audiences
  - For healthcare and financial services
  - For government/public services
  - When user demographics include older adults

signals:
  critical:
  - id: A11Y-AGE-CRIT-001
    signal: Base text size too small
    evidence_indicators:
    - Body text below 16px
    - Important information in small text
    - No way to increase text size
    explanation: |
      Older adults commonly need larger text due to presbyopia and other
      vision changes. Small text forces use of magnification tools that
      many older adults are unfamiliar with.
    remediation: |
      Use appropriate text sizes:
      - Minimum 16px for body text
      - 18px+ recommended for important content
      - Use relative units (rem, em) for scalability
      - Allow text size increase to 200% without loss
  - id: A11Y-AGE-CRIT-002
    signal: Insufficient contrast for aging vision
    evidence_indicators:
    - Text contrast below 4.5:1
    - Low contrast form elements
    - Subtle color differences for important information
    explanation: |
      Age-related contrast sensitivity loss means older adults need higher
      contrast than minimum WCAG requirements. What passes technical
      requirements may still be difficult.
    remediation: |
      Exceed minimum contrast requirements:
      - Aim for 7:1 contrast for body text
      - Avoid light gray text
      - Ensure form controls have clear boundaries
      - Don't rely on subtle color differences
  high:
  - id: A11Y-AGE-HIGH-001
    signal: Touch/click targets too small
    evidence_indicators:
    - Targets smaller than 44x44px
    - Dense layouts with small elements
    - Precise targeting required
    explanation: |
      Reduced motor control and precision make small targets difficult.
      Older adults may have tremor or arthritis affecting accuracy.
    remediation: |
      Size targets generously:
      - Minimum 44x44px touch targets
      - Larger for frequent actions
      - Adequate spacing between targets
      - Forgiving touch areas (larger clickable area than visual)
  - id: A11Y-AGE-HIGH-002
    signal: Hover-dependent functionality
    evidence_indicators:
    - Information only revealed on hover
    - Navigation dependent on hover states
    - No click alternative for hover actions
    explanation: |
      Hover interactions are difficult for users with tremor or using
      touch devices. Many older adults use tablets without hover capability.
    remediation: |
      Provide click/tap alternatives:
      - Don't hide essential info in hover states
      - Make hover content also click-accessible
      - Ensure all functionality works on touch devices
      - Consider click-to-reveal patterns
  - id: A11Y-AGE-HIGH-003
    signal: Time-limited interactions too short
    evidence_indicators:
    - Quick timeout on carousels
    - Session expires quickly
    - Time-limited to read content
    explanation: |
      Slower processing speed and reading pace mean older adults need
      more time for interactions and content consumption.
    remediation: |
      Allow adequate time:
      - Pause carousels or extend intervals
      - Generous session timeouts with warnings
      - No time limits on reading content
      - Allow pausing of auto-advancing content
  medium:
  - id: A11Y-AGE-MED-001
    signal: Complex navigation or unfamiliar patterns
    evidence_indicators:
    - Novel interaction patterns
    - Unclear navigation structure
    - Assumed familiarity with modern patterns
    explanation: |
      Older adults may be less familiar with modern web conventions and
      have more difficulty learning new interaction patterns.
    remediation: |
      Use familiar patterns:
      - Standard navigation conventions
      - Clear labels (not just icons)
      - Obvious interactive elements
      - Help and instructions available
  - id: A11Y-AGE-MED-002
    signal: Dense information presentation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Crowded layouts
    - Small line spacing
    - Many options presented at once
    explanation: |
      Information density increases cognitive load, which is more
      challenging with age-related cognitive changes.
    remediation: |
      Reduce density:
      - Adequate white space
      - Clear visual hierarchy
      - Progressive disclosure
      - 1.5+ line height for readability
  - id: A11Y-AGE-MED-003
    signal: Color used as sole differentiator
    evidence_indicators:
    - Status indicated only by color
    - Graph data distinguished only by color
    - No pattern or text alternative
    explanation: |
      Color vision changes with age. Relying solely on color excludes
      users who cannot distinguish the specific colors used.
    remediation: |
      Add redundant cues:
      - Text labels in addition to color
      - Patterns or icons for differentiation
      - Don't rely on specific color perception
      - Test with color blindness simulators
  low:
  - id: A11Y-AGE-LOW-001
    signal: Minor aging-related optimizations possible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Could be more forgiving
    - Some patterns less familiar
    explanation: |
      Application is generally accessible to older users but could
      benefit from optimization.
    remediation: |
      Gather feedback from older adult users.
