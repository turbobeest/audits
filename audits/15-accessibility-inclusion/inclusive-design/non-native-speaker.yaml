  what: |
    This audit evaluates how well the application supports users who are
    not native speakers of the primary language, including immigrants,
    international users, and those with English as a Second Language (ESL).

    Non-native speaker considerations include:
    - Simple, clear language avoiding idioms and colloquialisms
    - Visual communication to supplement text
    - Consistent terminology and phrasing
    - Clear sentence structure
    - Appropriate localization support
    - Machine translation compatibility
    - Cultural neutrality in icons and colors

    The audit examines:
    - Language complexity and idiom usage
    - Icon and color cultural appropriateness
    - Date, time, number formatting
    - Name and address format flexibility
    - Translation and localization support
    - Visual communication effectiveness
  why_it_matters: |
    The global internet user base is diverse:
    - English is a second language for most English site users
    - Many users use machine translation to access content
    - Cultural assumptions can create barriers
    - Idioms and colloquialisms don't translate

    Designing for non-native speakers:
    - Expands potential user base globally
    - Improves clarity for all users
    - Supports localization and translation
    - Reduces cultural exclusion
    - Enables global market reach
  when_to_run:
  - For international applications
  - When localization is planned
  - For diverse user populations
  - When cultural feedback is received

signals:
  critical:
  - id: A11Y-NNS-CRIT-001
    signal: Essential content relies on idioms
    evidence_indicators:
    - Idioms in error messages or instructions
    - Colloquialisms in critical content
    - Puns or wordplay in functional text
    explanation: |
      Idioms don't translate and are incomprehensible to non-native speakers.
      "Pull the plug" or "break a leg" cannot be understood literally.
    remediation: |
      Replace idioms with clear language:
      - "Pull the plug" -> "Stop" or "Cancel"
      - "Get the ball rolling" -> "Start"
      - Use concrete, literal language throughout
  - id: A11Y-NNS-CRIT-002
    signal: Cultural symbols exclude users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Culture-specific icons for critical functions
    - Colors with culture-specific meanings for status
    - Gestures or symbols with varying interpretations
    explanation: |
      Symbols that seem universal may have different or opposite meanings
      in other cultures. A thumbs-up is offensive in some cultures.
    remediation: |
      Use culturally neutral symbols:
      - Text labels in addition to icons
      - Avoid hand gestures
      - Research color meanings across cultures
      - Test with international users
  high:
  - id: A11Y-NNS-HIGH-001
    signal: Date/time/number formats not localized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dates in MM/DD/YYYY only
    - 12-hour time without AM/PM alternative
    - Comma/period number formatting hardcoded
    explanation: |
      Date, time, and number formats vary significantly by locale.
      US date format (MM/DD) is confusing for those expecting DD/MM.
    remediation: |
      Implement localization:
      - Use Intl API for formatting
      - Support user locale preferences
      - Show dates unambiguously (Jan 15, 2026)
      - Allow format preferences
  - id: A11Y-NNS-HIGH-002
    signal: Name and address fields culturally biased
    evidence_indicators:
    - Required first/last name fields
    - Address format assumes US/Western structure
    - Phone number format restrictions
    explanation: |
      Name structures vary globally (single names, family-first, patronymics).
      Address formats vary significantly by country.
    remediation: |
      Allow flexible input:
      - Single "Full Name" field or optional structure
      - Flexible address fields
      - International phone number support
      - Don't require ZIP/postal codes
  - id: A11Y-NNS-HIGH-003
    signal: No language selection available
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single language only
    - Language selection difficult to find
    - No auto-detection of preferred language
    explanation: |
      Users may prefer their native language or need to switch languages
      to understand content.
    remediation: |
      Support language access:
      - Visible language selector
      - Detect browser language preference
      - Remember user language choice
      - Plan for localization
  medium:
  - id: A11Y-NNS-MED-001
    signal: Complex sentence structures
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long, complex sentences
    - Nested clauses and conditionals
    - Passive voice overuse
    explanation: |
      Complex sentence structures are harder for non-native speakers to
      parse and understand correctly.
    remediation: |
      Simplify sentence structure:
      - Short, direct sentences
      - Active voice
      - One idea per sentence
      - Clear subject-verb-object structure
  - id: A11Y-NNS-MED-002
    signal: Content doesn't translate well
    evidence_indicators:
    - Machine translation produces nonsense
    - UI breaks with translated longer strings
    - No space for text expansion
    explanation: |
      If users rely on machine translation, poorly-structured content
      will translate badly. UI not designed for localization breaks.
    remediation: |
      Design for translation:
      - Clear, simple source text
      - Allow 30-50% text expansion in UI
      - Avoid concatenating strings
      - Test with machine translation
  - id: A11Y-NNS-MED-003
    signal: Abbreviations not explained
    evidence_indicators:
    - Abbreviations without expansion
    - Acronyms assumed known
    - Shorthand in content
    explanation: |
      Abbreviations may be unknown to international users and don't
      translate via machine translation.
    remediation: |
      Expand abbreviations:
      - Spell out on first use
      - Provide tooltips or glossary
      - Avoid abbreviations where possible
  low:
  - id: A11Y-NNS-LOW-001
    signal: Minor internationalization improvements possible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some locale-specific assumptions
    - Could be more culturally neutral
    explanation: |
      Application generally supports international users but could
      improve in specific areas.
    remediation: |
      Continue internationalization improvements.
