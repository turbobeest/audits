  what: |
    This audit examines the documentation of environment configurations,
    architecture, access procedures, and operational runbooks. It evaluates
    whether teams can understand, access, and operate environments
    effectively using available documentation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor environment documentation extends incident response times, creates
    knowledge silos, complicates onboarding, and increases operational risk.
    Well-documented environments enable faster debugging, safer changes,
    and better team collaboration.
  when_to_run:
  - During onboarding of new team members
  - After major environment changes
  - Before disaster recovery exercises
  - Quarterly documentation reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ENVDOC-CRIT-001
    signal: No documentation exists for production environment access
    evidence_indicators:
    - New team members cannot find how to access production
    - Access procedures exist only in tribal knowledge
    explanation: |
      Missing access documentation creates single points of failure
      and delays incident response when key personnel are unavailable.
    remediation: Create comprehensive access documentation with step-by-step procedures
  - id: ENVDOC-CRIT-002
    signal: Emergency procedures undocumented or outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Disaster recovery steps not documented
    - Emergency runbooks reference deprecated systems
    explanation: |
      Outdated or missing emergency documentation extends incident
      duration and increases likelihood of errors during crisis.
    remediation: Create and regularly validate emergency runbooks
  high:
  - id: ENVDOC-HIGH-001
    signal: Environment architecture diagrams missing or outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Diagrams show components that no longer exist
    - No visual representation of environment topology
    explanation: |
      Missing architecture diagrams slow down debugging and make
      impact analysis difficult during changes.
    remediation: Create and maintain architecture diagrams with regular review cycle
  - id: ENVDOC-HIGH-002
    signal: No documentation of environment differences and rationale
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unexplained differences between staging and production
    - No ADRs for environment-specific decisions
    explanation: |
      Undocumented differences lead to assumptions that cause
      deployment failures and debugging confusion.
    remediation: Document all intentional environment differences with rationale
  medium:
  - id: ENVDOC-MED-001
    signal: Documentation scattered across multiple systems
    remediation: Consolidate environment documentation with clear navigation
  - id: ENVDOC-MED-002
    signal: No documentation review or update process
    remediation: Implement regular documentation review cycle tied to environment changes
  low:
  - id: ENVDOC-LOW-001
    signal: Documentation lacks consistent formatting or structure
  positive:
  - id: ENVDOC-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive environment documentation with regular review cycle
  - id: ENVDOC-POS-002
    signal: Documentation automated from infrastructure code
