  what: |
    This audit examines release scheduling practices including deployment
    windows, freeze periods, change management coordination, timezone
    considerations, and stakeholder notification. It evaluates whether
    releases are timed to minimize risk and disruption.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor release scheduling leads to incidents during peak usage,
    insufficient support coverage during deployments, and conflicts
    with business events. Strategic scheduling reduces incident
    impact and ensures appropriate support availability.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing release cadence
  - After incidents caused by timing issues
  - Before major business events
  - Quarterly process reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RELSCD-CRIT-001
    signal: Deployments during peak traffic without mitigation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deployments scheduled during business hours without traffic management
    - No gradual rollout configured for peak-time deployments
    explanation: |
      Peak-time deployments maximize user impact if issues occur
      and complicate rollback due to high load.
    remediation: Implement deployment windows during low-traffic periods or use progressive rollout
  - id: RELSCD-CRIT-002
    signal: Deployments when no support coverage available
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deployments outside business hours without on-call
    - No incident response available during deployment window
    explanation: |
      Deployments without support coverage leave issues undetected
      or unresolved for extended periods.
    remediation: Ensure support coverage during and after all production deployments
  high:
  - id: RELSCD-HIGH-001
    signal: No deployment freeze calendar for critical periods
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deployments during major business events
    - No blackout periods defined
    explanation: |
      Deployments during critical business periods create
      disproportionate risk and business impact.
    remediation: Establish and enforce deployment freeze periods for major events
  - id: RELSCD-HIGH-002
    signal: Timezone considerations ignored for global systems
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single deployment window ignores global user distribution
    - No regional deployment strategy
    explanation: |
      Ignoring timezones means deployments always impact some
      users during their peak hours.
    remediation: Implement timezone-aware deployment scheduling or regional rollout
  medium:
  - id: RELSCD-MED-001
    signal: No advance notification for scheduled deployments
    remediation: Implement stakeholder notification for planned deployments
  - id: RELSCD-MED-002
    signal: Deployment schedule conflicts with change management
    remediation: Integrate deployment scheduling with change management processes
  low:
  - id: RELSCD-LOW-001
    signal: Deployment windows not documented
  positive:
  - id: RELSCD-POS-001
    signal: Clear deployment windows with stakeholder buy-in
