  what: |
    This audit examines the release notes generation process including
    automation, content quality, categorization of changes, and
    communication to stakeholders. It evaluates whether release notes
    accurately convey the impact and content of releases.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor or missing release notes leave stakeholders uninformed about
    changes, complicate upgrade decisions, and increase support burden.
    Clear release notes enable informed adoption, faster troubleshooting,
    and better change management.
  when_to_run:
  - Before establishing release processes
  - After complaints about release communication
  - When onboarding documentation practices
  - Quarterly process reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RELNOT-CRIT-001
    signal: Breaking changes not documented in release notes
    evidence_indicators:
    - BREAKING CHANGE commits without corresponding release notes
    - API changes not communicated to consumers
    explanation: |
      Undocumented breaking changes cause unexpected failures for
      consumers and erode trust in the release process.
    remediation: Implement mandatory breaking change documentation; automate detection
  - id: RELNOT-CRIT-002
    signal: Security fixes released without advisory
    evidence_indicators:
    - Security patches without security advisory
    - CVE fixes not highlighted in release notes
    explanation: |
      Users cannot prioritize security updates if they are not
      clearly communicated, leaving systems vulnerable.
    remediation: Create security advisory process; highlight security fixes prominently
  high:
  - id: RELNOT-HIGH-001
    signal: No release notes generated for releases
    evidence_indicators:
    - Git tags without associated release notes
    - Published packages without changelogs
    explanation: |
      Missing release notes leave consumers guessing about changes
      and make upgrade decisions difficult.
    remediation: Implement automated release notes generation from commits
  - id: RELNOT-HIGH-002
    signal: Release notes not categorized by change type
    evidence_pattern: changelog|release.*notes
    explanation: |
      Uncategorized release notes make it difficult to assess
      impact and find relevant information quickly.
    remediation: Categorize changes (features, fixes, breaking changes, etc.)
  medium:
  - id: RELNOT-MED-001
    signal: Commits do not follow conventional format
    evidence_pattern: '^[a-z]+:'
    remediation: Implement conventional commit enforcement with commit hooks
  - id: RELNOT-MED-002
    signal: Release notes not published alongside artifacts
    remediation: Automate release notes publishing to package registries and GitHub
  low:
  - id: RELNOT-LOW-001
    signal: Release notes lack contributor attribution
  positive:
  - id: RELNOT-POS-001
    signal: Automated release notes from conventional commits
  - id: RELNOT-POS-002
    signal: Release notes include migration guides for breaking changes
