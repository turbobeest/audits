  what: |
    This audit examines release communication practices including
    pre-release announcements, deployment notifications, status updates,
    post-deployment summaries, and stakeholder-appropriate messaging.
    It evaluates whether all stakeholders receive timely, relevant information.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor release communication leaves stakeholders uninformed, creates
    confusion during incidents, and undermines confidence in releases.
    Clear communication enables proactive preparation, faster issue
    identification, and better change adoption.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing release processes
  - After communication-related incidents
  - During stakeholder feedback reviews
  - Quarterly process assessments

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RELCOM-CRIT-001
    signal: No notification for production deployments
    evidence_indicators:
    - Production deployments occur without any announcement
    - Stakeholders unaware of changes until issues arise
    explanation: |
      Unannounced deployments prevent proactive monitoring, delay
      issue identification, and create support confusion.
    remediation: Implement mandatory deployment notifications to all stakeholders
  - id: RELCOM-CRIT-002
    signal: Breaking changes not communicated to API consumers
    evidence_indicators:
    - API breaking changes released without advance notice
    - Consumers report unexpected breakage
    explanation: |
      Uncommunicated breaking changes cause consumer failures and
      erode trust in the platform.
    remediation: Implement advance notice for breaking changes with migration timeline
  high:
  - id: RELCOM-HIGH-001
    signal: No differentiation of communication by audience
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same message sent to all stakeholders regardless of relevance
    - Technical details shared with non-technical stakeholders
    explanation: |
      One-size-fits-all communication creates noise and obscures
      relevant information for each audience.
    remediation: Develop audience-specific communication templates and channels
  - id: RELCOM-HIGH-002
    signal: Deployment status not visible during release
    evidence_indicators:
    - No status page or dashboard during deployments
    - Stakeholders cannot determine deployment progress
    explanation: |
      Invisible deployment status creates uncertainty and
      duplicate inquiries during releases.
    remediation: Implement real-time deployment status visibility
  medium:
  - id: RELCOM-MED-001
    signal: Post-deployment summary not shared
    remediation: Send post-deployment summary with changes and any issues encountered
  - id: RELCOM-MED-002
    signal: Communication not automated
    remediation: Automate release notifications through CI/CD pipeline
  low:
  - id: RELCOM-LOW-001
    signal: No feedback mechanism for release communication
  positive:
  - id: RELCOM-POS-001
    signal: Automated, audience-appropriate release notifications
  - id: RELCOM-POS-002
    signal: Status page integration with deployment pipeline
