description:
  what: |
    Evaluates compliance with Service Level Agreements for business integrations.
    This audit examines response time requirements, availability targets, throughput
    commitments, and error rate thresholds. It ensures the system meets contractual
    SLA obligations to partners and customers.
  why_it_matters: |
    SLA violations result in financial penalties, damaged relationships, and
    lost business. Understanding SLA requirements and measuring compliance is
    essential for maintaining partner trust and avoiding contractual penalties.
  when_to_run:
  - Before new partner integrations go live
  - During periodic SLA reviews
  - After SLA violations
  - When renegotiating contracts

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SLA-CRIT-001
    signal: SLA violations occurring regularly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Frequent availability breaches
    - Response times exceeding limits
    - Penalty clauses triggered
    explanation: |
      Regular SLA violations incur penalties, damage relationships, and
      may lead to contract termination.
    remediation: Investigate root causes; implement improvements; adjust capacity
  - id: SLA-CRIT-002
    signal: SLA requirements not monitored
    evidence_indicators:
    - No dashboards for SLA metrics
    - Cannot report on SLA compliance
    - Violations discovered by partners
    explanation: |
      Without monitoring, SLA violations go undetected until partners
      report them, damaging trust and incurring avoidable penalties.
    remediation: Implement SLA monitoring and alerting
  high:
  - id: SLA-HIGH-001
    signal: Approaching SLA thresholds consistently
    evidence_indicators:
    - Metrics near SLA limits
    - Narrow margin to violations
    - No buffer for traffic spikes
    remediation: Improve performance margins; add capacity
  - id: SLA-HIGH-002
    signal: SLA requirements not clearly defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - Ambiguous SLA terms
    - Measurement methodology unclear
    - Different interpretations of requirements
    remediation: Clarify SLA definitions with partners; document measurement methods
  medium:
  - id: SLA-MED-001
    signal: SLA reporting not automated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Manual SLA reports
    - Delayed compliance reporting
    - Inconsistent measurement
    remediation: Automate SLA measurement and reporting
  - id: SLA-MED-002
    signal: No proactive SLA degradation alerts
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only alerting after breach
    - No early warning system
    - Cannot prevent violations
    remediation: Add proactive alerts at percentage of SLA threshold
  low:
  - id: SLA-LOW-001
    signal: SLA documentation not accessible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Team unaware of SLA requirements
    - SLAs in contracts only
    remediation: Document SLAs in operational runbooks
  positive:
  - id: SLA-POS-001
    signal: Consistent SLA compliance with margins
  - id: SLA-POS-002
    signal: Automated SLA monitoring and reporting
