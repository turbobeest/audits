description:
  what: |
    Evaluates whether all significant business events are captured and published.
    This audit compares business processes with emitted events, identifies missing
    events, and ensures consumers have the events they need. It ensures the event
    stream fully represents business activity.
  why_it_matters: |
    Missing business events prevent downstream systems from reacting to important
    changes. This causes integration gaps, stale caches, missing notifications,
    and broken analytics. Complete event coverage is essential for event-driven
    architectures to work properly.
  when_to_run:
  - When designing event-driven systems
  - After adding new business features
  - When integrating new consumers
  - During event coverage reviews

  interview_questions:
  - role: Business Analyst
    questions:
    - What are the key business events that occur?
    - What changes need to trigger notifications or updates?
    - What events would you want to analyze?
  - role: Integration Developer
    questions:
    - What events are you missing from producers?
    - What business changes do you need to react to?
    - Are there gaps in event coverage?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: BEC-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical business events not published
    evidence_indicators:
    - Major state changes not communicated
    - Consumers polling for changes
    - Manual synchronization required
    explanation: |
      Missing critical business events force consumers to use inefficient
      polling or manual processes. This creates latency, inconsistency,
      and operational burden.
    remediation: Identify and publish all critical business events
  high:
  - id: BEC-HIGH-001
    signal: Events missing for downstream consumer needs
    evidence_indicators:
    - Consumers requesting new events
    - Integration workarounds in place
    - Point-to-point integrations instead of events
    remediation: Survey consumers; add events for common needs
  - id: BEC-HIGH-002
    signal: Events published for only some paths to same outcome
    evidence_indicators:
    - Event from UI but not API
    - Event from online but not batch
    - Inconsistent event coverage
    remediation: Ensure events published regardless of trigger path
  medium:
  - id: BEC-MED-001
    signal: No event for state changes in new features
    evidence_indicators:
    - New features without corresponding events
    - Event additions not part of feature definition
    - Event coverage lagging behind features
    remediation: Include event design in feature development
  - id: BEC-MED-002
    signal: Events missing business context
    evidence_indicators:
    - Events without enough data for consumers
    - Consumers making additional API calls
    - Event payloads too minimal
    remediation: Add business-relevant context to events
  low:
  - id: BEC-LOW-001
    signal: Event catalog not maintained
    evidence_indicators:
    - Undocumented events
    - Catalog out of date
    remediation: Maintain comprehensive event catalog
  positive:
  - id: BEC-POS-001
    signal: Event Storming used to identify business events
  - id: BEC-POS-002
    signal: Complete event coverage for all business processes
