description:
  what: |
    Evaluates how business processes are bounded and separated. This audit examines
    process start and end triggers, input/output contracts, cross-process
    interactions, and process isolation. It ensures that processes have clear
    boundaries, well-defined responsibilities, and minimal coupling with other
    processes.
  why_it_matters: |
    Unclear process boundaries lead to tangled workflows that are difficult to
    understand, modify, and test. When processes overlap or have unclear handoffs,
    responsibilities become ambiguous, causing bugs and maintenance issues.
    Clear boundaries enable independent process evolution and testing.
  when_to_run:
  - During process design reviews
  - When refactoring monolithic processes
  - Before process decomposition
  - When experiencing process coupling issues

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PBD-CRIT-001
    signal: Processes directly modify each other's state
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cross-process database writes
    - Direct state manipulation between processes
    - No clear ownership of data
    explanation: |
      When processes directly modify each other's state, boundaries are
      violated, creating tight coupling and data integrity risks. Each
      process should own its state exclusively.
    remediation: Establish clear state ownership; use events or APIs for cross-process communication
  high:
  - id: PBD-HIGH-001
    signal: Unclear process start conditions
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple ways to start same process
    - Implicit process triggers
    - Side effects that trigger processes
    remediation: Define explicit process triggers; document entry points
  - id: PBD-HIGH-002
    signal: Process boundaries not aligned with business capabilities
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single process spans multiple business capabilities
    - Related activities split across processes
    - Process scope mismatch with team ownership
    remediation: Realign process boundaries with business capabilities
  medium:
  - id: PBD-MED-001
    signal: Process input/output contracts not defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No schema for process inputs
    - Undocumented output formats
    - Implicit contract assumptions
    remediation: Define explicit input/output contracts; validate at boundaries
  - id: PBD-MED-002
    signal: Process end conditions ambiguous
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unclear when process is complete
    - Multiple end states without clear distinction
    - No success/failure definition
    remediation: Define explicit end conditions; document outcome criteria
  low:
  - id: PBD-LOW-001
    signal: Process documentation does not match implementation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Documented boundaries differ from code
    - Stale process documentation
    remediation: Synchronize documentation with implementation
  positive:
  - id: PBD-POS-001
    signal: Clear process boundaries with well-defined contracts
  - id: PBD-POS-002
    signal: Processes align with business capabilities
