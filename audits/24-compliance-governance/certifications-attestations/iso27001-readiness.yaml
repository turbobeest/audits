  what: |
    Comprehensive assessment of organizational readiness for ISO/IEC 27001
    certification. Evaluates the Information Security Management System (ISMS)
    against the standard's requirements including context, leadership, planning,
    support, operation, performance evaluation, and improvement (clauses 4-10),
    as well as Annex A controls. Identifies gaps that would prevent successful
    Stage 1 and Stage 2 certification audits.
  why_it_matters: |
    ISO 27001 certification provides:
    - International recognition of security practices
    - Required for many government and enterprise contracts
    - Competitive advantage in security-conscious markets
    - Framework for continuous security improvement
    - Insurance premium reductions

    Failed certification attempts cost significant time and money, damage
    credibility, and delay business opportunities requiring certification.
  when_to_run:
  - Before starting ISO 27001 certification journey
  - 6-12 months before planned certification audit
  - After major ISMS changes
  - During annual ISMS review
  - Before surveillance or recertification audits

      Evaluate organization against each clause:
      - Clause 4: Context of the organization
      - Clause 5: Leadership
      - Clause 6: Planning
      - Clause 7: Support
      - Clause 8: Operation
      - Clause 9: Performance evaluation
      - Clause 10: Improvement

      And Annex A control categories (2022 version):
      - A.5: Organizational controls
      - A.6: People controls
      - A.7: Physical controls
      - A.8: Technological controls
signals:

    signal: No ISMS scope defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - ISMS boundaries not documented
    - No context analysis performed
    - Interested parties not identified
    - Scope statement missing
    explanation: |
      Clause 4 requires documented scope. Certification auditors will
      immediately identify missing scope as a major non-conformity.
      Certification cannot proceed without defined scope.
    remediation: |
      1. Document organizational context (4.1)
      2. Identify interested parties and requirements (4.2)
      3. Define ISMS scope and boundaries (4.3)
      4. Obtain management approval for scope
      5. Communicate scope to relevant parties

    evidence_indicators:
    - No risk assessment methodology
    - No documented risk assessment results
    - Risks not identified or rated
    - No risk treatment plan
    explanation: |
      Clause 6.1.2 requires documented risk assessment process and results.
      This is fundamental to ISO 27001 - controls should be selected based
      on risk assessment.
    remediation: |
      1. Establish risk assessment methodology
      2. Define risk criteria

    - SoA not aligned with risk assessment
    explanation: |
      Clause 6.1.3 requires Statement of Applicability. This is a mandatory
      documented output that auditors will review. Missing or incomplete
      SoA is a major non-conformity.
    remediation: |
      1. List all Annex A controls
      2. Determine applicability based on risk assessment
      3. Justify each inclusion or exclusion
      4. Document implementation status
