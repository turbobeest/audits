description:
  what: |
    Comprehensive assessment of readiness for FedRAMP (Federal Risk and
    Authorization Management Program) authorization. Evaluates compliance
    with NIST SP 800-53 controls at the appropriate impact level (Low,
    Moderate, High), documentation requirements (SSP, POA&M, SAR, SAP),
    continuous monitoring capabilities, and organizational readiness for
    the authorization process.
  why_it_matters: |
    FedRAMP authorization is required for cloud services used by U.S.
    federal agencies:
    - Opens $80B+ federal cloud market
    - Average authorization takes 12-18 months
    - Costs $500K-$2M+ for initial authorization
    - Failed authorization attempts waste significant resources
    - Readiness assessment identifies gaps early

    The authorization process is rigorous - FedRAMP Ready status requires
    meeting all baseline requirements before authorization can proceed.
  when_to_run:
  - Before committing to FedRAMP authorization
  - When pursuing FedRAMP Ready status
  - 12-18 months before desired authorization
  - Before engaging Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO)
  - During annual assessment preparation

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FEDRAMP-CRIT-001
    signal: System boundary not defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No authorization boundary documentation
    - Data flows not mapped
    - External services not identified
    - Interconnections not documented
    explanation: |
      FedRAMP requires precise authorization boundary definition.
      Without clear boundary, 3PAO cannot assess scope and PMO
      cannot grant authorization.
    remediation: |
      1. Define system authorization boundary
      2. Document all system components
      3. Map all data flows
      4. Identify all external services and interconnections
      5. Create boundary network diagram
  - id: FEDRAMP-CRIT-002
    signal: No System Security Plan
    evidence_indicators:
    - SSP does not exist
    - SSP doesn't use FedRAMP template
    - SSP significantly incomplete
    - Control implementations not documented
    explanation: |
      SSP is the primary authorization document. Without complete
      SSP using FedRAMP template, authorization cannot proceed.
    remediation: |
      1. Download current FedRAMP SSP template
      2. Complete all sections with system specifics
      3. Document control implementations
      4. Obtain senior management approval
      5. Keep SSP current with system changes
  - id: FEDRAMP-CRIT-003
    signal: Major NIST control gaps at target impact level
    evidence_indicators:
    - Required controls not implemented
    - Control implementations don't meet requirements
    - Compensating controls not documented
    - Significant POA&M items remain
    explanation: |
      FedRAMP requires all controls at target impact level. Major
      gaps result in failed 3PAO assessment and cannot be authorized.
    remediation: |
      1. Complete control gap assessment
      2. Implement missing controls
      3. Document compensating controls where applicable
      4. Create POA&M for items requiring remediation
      5. Prioritize critical/high findings
  - id: FEDRAMP-CRIT-004
    signal: No continuous monitoring capability
    evidence_indicators:
    - No vulnerability scanning program
    - No security monitoring tools
    - No POA&M management process
    - No incident detection capability
    explanation: |
      FedRAMP requires continuous monitoring. Authorization requires
      demonstration of ConMon capability before ATO is granted.
    remediation: |
      1. Implement monthly vulnerability scanning
      2. Deploy security monitoring tools
      3. Establish POA&M management process
      4. Define significant change process
      5. Create ConMon strategy document
  high:
  - id: FEDRAMP-HIGH-001
    signal: Penetration test not conducted or insufficient
    evidence_indicators:
    - No penetration test performed
    - Test doesn't meet FedRAMP requirements
    - Test scope doesn't cover boundary
    - Findings not remediated
    explanation: |
      Annual penetration testing is required. 3PAO will conduct
      assessment that includes pen testing, but CSP should have
      recent results.
    remediation: |
      1. Engage qualified penetration tester
      2. Ensure scope covers authorization boundary
      3. Include all FedRAMP required test cases
      4. Remediate critical and high findings
      5. Document remediation evidence
  - id: FEDRAMP-HIGH-002
    signal: FIPS 140-2 encryption not implemented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Encryption not FIPS 140-2 validated
    - Data at rest not encrypted
    - Data in transit not encrypted
    - Cryptographic modules not identified
    explanation: |
      FedRAMP requires FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography. Using
      non-validated modules is a significant gap.
    remediation: |
      1. Inventory all cryptographic modules
      2. Verify FIPS 140-2 validation
      3. Replace non-validated modules
      4. Document cryptographic architecture
      5. Maintain FIPS validation certificates
  - id: FEDRAMP-HIGH-003
    signal: Incident response capability inadequate
    evidence_indicators:
    - No incident response plan
    - US-CERT reporting not possible
    - No incident detection capability
    - Response times don't meet requirements
    explanation: |
      FedRAMP requires incident response capability with specific
      reporting requirements to US-CERT/CISA.
    remediation: |
      1. Develop FedRAMP-compliant IR plan
      2. Establish US-CERT reporting capability
      3. Define incident response roles
      4. Test incident response annually
      5. Document IR evidence
  - id: FEDRAMP-HIGH-004
    signal: Multi-factor authentication not implemented
    evidence_indicators:
    - MFA not required for privileged users
    - MFA not implemented for remote access
    - Weak MFA implementation
    - MFA gaps in boundary
    explanation: |
      MFA is required for all privileged access and remote access.
      This is a baseline control at all impact levels.
    remediation: |
      1. Implement MFA for all privileged accounts
      2. Require MFA for all remote access
      3. Implement PIV/CAC where required
      4. Document MFA architecture
      5. Monitor MFA compliance

  - id: FEDRAMP-MED-001
    signal: Configuration management incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - No baseline configurations
    - Change management informal
    - Configuration monitoring absent
    - Deviations not tracked
    remediation: |
      1. Establish baseline configurations
      2. Implement configuration management process
      3. Deploy configuration monitoring
      4. Track and approve deviations
      5. Automate compliance checking

    signal: Personnel security controls incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - Background checks not performed
    - Access agreements missing
    - Security training not conducted
    - Termination process inadequate
    remediation: |
      1. Implement background check process
      2. Create access agreement templates
      3. Conduct security awareness training
      4. Implement termination procedures
      5. Maintain personnel security records

    remediation: |
      1. Develop contingency plan
      2. Implement backup procedures
      3. Test recovery annually
      4. Establish alternate processing
      5. Document and test plans
