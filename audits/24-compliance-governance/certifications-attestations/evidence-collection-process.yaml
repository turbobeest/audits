description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of compliance evidence
    collection processes. Assesses how evidence is gathered, organized,
    retained, and made available for audits. Examines automation level,
    evidence quality, completeness, and the sustainability of evidence
    collection practices for ongoing compliance.
  why_it_matters: |
    Evidence collection is the foundation of compliance:
    - Audits require evidence for every control
    - Manual collection is expensive and error-prone
    - Missing evidence can cause failed audits
    - Continuous compliance requires continuous evidence

    Effective evidence processes enable efficient audits and sustainable
    compliance programs.
  when_to_run:
  - Before compliance assessments
  - When establishing compliance program
  - When audit findings cite evidence issues
  - When evaluating compliance automation tools
  - During compliance program optimization
signals:
  critical:
  - id: EVIDENCE-CRIT-001
    signal: Evidence collection is entirely manual and ad-hoc
    evidence_indicators:
    - No systematic evidence collection
    - Evidence gathered only before audits
    - Evidence scattered across systems
    - Significant evidence gaps
    explanation: |
      Manual, ad-hoc evidence collection leads to missing evidence,
      audit scrambles, and unsustainable compliance burden.
    remediation: |
      1. Map evidence requirements to controls
      2. Identify evidence sources
      3. Implement collection schedule
      4. Automate where possible
      5. Create evidence repository
  - id: EVIDENCE-CRIT-002
    signal: Evidence retention inadequate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Evidence deleted before audit period
    - Retention policies not followed
    - Cannot demonstrate historical compliance
    - Logs rotate too quickly
    explanation: |
      Insufficient retention means evidence doesn't exist when
      needed. SOC 2 Type II and others require evidence over
      the audit period.
    remediation: |
      1. Define retention requirements by evidence type
      2. Implement retention policies
      3. Verify retention actually happens
      4. Archive evidence appropriately
      5. Monitor retention compliance
  high:
  - id: EVIDENCE-HIGH-001
    signal: Evidence not mapped to controls
    evidence_indicators:
    - No control-to-evidence mapping
    - Unsure what evidence satisfies what controls
    - Duplicate evidence collection
    - Gap discovery during audits
    explanation: |
      Without mapping, you don't know if you have the right evidence
      until an auditor asks for it. This causes audit delays.
    remediation: |
      1. Create control matrix
      2. Map evidence to each control
      3. Identify evidence sources
      4. Verify coverage completeness
      5. Maintain mapping current
  - id: EVIDENCE-HIGH-002
    signal: Evidence quality insufficient
    evidence_indicators:
    - Evidence doesn't demonstrate control operation
    - Screenshots without context
    - Evidence doesn't cover audit period
    - Auditors request additional evidence
    explanation: |
      Low-quality evidence requires rework and may not satisfy
      auditors. Evidence should clearly demonstrate control operation.
    remediation: |
      1. Define evidence quality standards
      2. Include timestamps and context
      3. Show control operation, not just existence
      4. Review evidence before audits
      5. Address auditor feedback patterns
  medium:
  - id: EVIDENCE-MED-001
    signal: No compliance automation
    evidence_indicators:
    - All evidence collected manually
    - No compliance management platform
    - Significant personnel time spent
    remediation: |
      1. Evaluate compliance automation platforms
      2. Automate repetitive evidence collection
      3. Integrate with source systems
      4. Reduce manual burden
  - id: EVIDENCE-MED-002
    signal: Evidence collection undocumented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented collection process
    - Key-person dependency
    - Inconsistent collection
    remediation: |
      1. Document collection procedures
      2. Define roles and responsibilities
      3. Create collection calendar
      4. Cross-train team members
  positive:
  - id: EVIDENCE-POS-001

    - Real-time compliance visibility
  - id: EVIDENCE-POS-002
    signal: Complete control-evidence mapping
    evidence_indicators:
    - Every control has mapped evidence
    - Evidence sources documented
    - Coverage verified
