description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the appropriateness and accuracy of certification scope for
    compliance attestations (SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, HITRUST, etc.).
    Assesses whether scope accurately reflects what customers expect is
    covered, whether boundaries are clearly defined, and whether scope
    statements in certificates match actual system coverage.
  why_it_matters: |
    Certification scope directly affects customer reliance:
    - Narrow scope may exclude systems customers assume are covered
    - Scope gaps create false sense of security
    - Misrepresented scope creates legal liability
    - Customers may discover scope limitations during vendor assessment

    Clear, appropriate scope builds trust; misleading scope destroys it.
  when_to_run:
  - Before certification examinations
  - When customers question certification coverage
  - After significant system changes
  - During certification renewal
  - When expanding product offerings
signals:
  critical:
  - id: SCOPE-CRIT-001
    signal: Certification scope misleadingly narrow
    evidence_indicators:
    - Core product features excluded from scope
    - Customer-facing systems not covered
    - Scope excludes commonly-used integrations
    - Customers assume broader coverage
    explanation: |
      Narrow scope that excludes what customers expect creates
      false reliance and potential liability when discovered.
    remediation: |
      1. Align scope with customer expectations
      2. Include all customer-facing systems
      3. Document scope limitations clearly
      4. Expand certification scope if needed
  - id: SCOPE-CRIT-002
    signal: Scope statement doesn't match reality
    evidence_indicators:
    - Systems in scope have changed
    - Scope description outdated
    - Architecture differs from documentation
    - New systems not added to scope
    explanation: |
      Scope statements that don't reflect current reality mislead
      customers and create audit risk.
    remediation: |
      1. Review current system architecture
      2. Update scope documentation
      3. Align certification with actual systems
      4. Communicate scope changes
  high:
  - id: SCOPE-HIGH-001
    signal: Scope boundaries unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - Boundary not precisely defined
    - Shared responsibility unclear
    - External services not documented
    - Customer responsibilities undefined
    explanation: |
      Unclear boundaries create confusion about what's covered
      and who is responsible for what.
    remediation: |
      1. Define precise boundaries
      2. Document all external services
      3. Clarify shared responsibilities
      4. Communicate boundaries to customers
  medium:
  - id: SCOPE-MED-001
    signal: Scope not communicated to customers
    evidence_indicators:
    - Scope details not shared
    - Certificate scope hard to find
    - Marketing implies broader coverage
    remediation: |
      1. Make scope information accessible
      2. Align marketing with actual scope
      3. Proactively communicate scope
  positive:
  - id: SCOPE-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive, clear scope
    evidence_indicators:
    - All relevant systems included
    - Boundaries clearly defined
    - Scope communicated transparently
