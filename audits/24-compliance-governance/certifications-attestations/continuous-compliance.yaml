description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the organization's ability to maintain continuous compliance
    rather than point-in-time compliance. Assesses monitoring capabilities,
    drift detection, automated alerting, remediation processes, and the
    sustainability of compliance posture between formal audits.
  why_it_matters: |
    Point-in-time compliance is insufficient:
    - Configuration drift occurs continuously
    - Annual audits don't catch interim issues
    - Compliance failures can occur silently
    - Customers increasingly expect real-time compliance

    Continuous compliance provides ongoing assurance and reduces audit
    preparation burden.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing compliance automation
  - After compliance incidents from drift
  - During compliance program maturation
  - When evaluating compliance tools
  - Before audit prep to assess readiness
signals:
  critical:
  - id: CONTCOMP-CRIT-001
    signal: No monitoring of compliance posture
    evidence_indicators:
    - Compliance status unknown between audits
    - No automated compliance checking
    - Drift discovered only during audits
    - Cannot answer 'are we compliant now?'
    explanation: |
      Without monitoring, compliance is aspirational, not actual.
      Issues compound between audits, making remediation expensive.
    remediation: |
      1. Implement compliance monitoring
      2. Define compliance metrics
      3. Create compliance dashboard
      4. Establish regular review cadence
      5. Alert on compliance deviations
  - id: CONTCOMP-CRIT-002
    signal: No drift detection or alerting
    evidence_indicators:
    - Configuration changes unmonitored
    - Compliance violations not detected
    - No automated alerting
    - Manual compliance checking only
    explanation: |
      Without drift detection, compliant configurations can become
      non-compliant without anyone knowing until the next audit.
    remediation: |
      1. Implement configuration monitoring
      2. Define compliance baselines
      3. Alert on baseline deviations
      4. Automate drift detection
      5. Establish remediation workflows
  high:
  - id: CONTCOMP-HIGH-001
    signal: Remediation process ad-hoc
    evidence_indicators:
    - No defined remediation process
    - Compliance issues not tracked
    - Remediation timelines unclear
    - Issues remain open indefinitely
    explanation: |
      Without systematic remediation, compliance issues accumulate.
      Ad-hoc remediation creates audit findings.
    remediation: |
      1. Define remediation process
      2. Establish SLAs by severity
      3. Track issues to closure
      4. Report on remediation metrics
      5. Escalate overdue items
  - id: CONTCOMP-HIGH-002
    signal: Compliance not integrated with DevOps
    evidence_indicators:
    - Compliance checks not in CI/CD
    - Deployments can violate compliance
    - Security team separate from development
    - Compliance is afterthought
    explanation: |
      Compliance that's separate from development creates friction
      and allows non-compliant changes to deploy.
    remediation: |
      1. Integrate compliance checks in CI/CD
      2. Prevent non-compliant deployments
      3. Shift compliance left
      4. Embed compliance in development
  medium:
  - id: CONTCOMP-MED-001
    signal: No real-time compliance visibility
    evidence_indicators:
    - Compliance dashboard doesn't exist
    - Status requires manual compilation
    - Stakeholders can't see compliance status
    remediation: |
      1. Implement compliance dashboard
      2. Provide real-time status
      3. Enable self-service visibility
      4. Report on trends
  positive:
  - id: CONTCOMP-POS-001
    signal: Automated continuous monitoring
    evidence_indicators:
    - Real-time compliance visibility
    - Automated drift detection
    - Immediate alerting
    - Compliance as code
