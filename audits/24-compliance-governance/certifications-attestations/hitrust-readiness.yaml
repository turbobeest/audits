description:
  what: |
    Assessment of organizational readiness for HITRUST CSF (Common Security
    Framework) certification. Evaluates compliance with HITRUST requirements
    which integrate multiple regulatory standards (HIPAA, NIST, ISO 27001,
    PCI DSS, etc.) into a single certifiable framework. Determines appropriate
    assessment type (e1, i1, r2) and identifies gaps in control implementation
    and evidence collection.
  why_it_matters: |
    HITRUST certification is increasingly required in healthcare:
    - Required by many healthcare organizations for vendors
    - Demonstrates HIPAA compliance through certification
    - Reduces vendor assessment burden (assessed once, accepted many)
    - Average assessment takes 6-12 months
    - Costs $50K-$200K+ depending on assessment type

    HITRUST r2 certification provides the highest level of assurance and
    is preferred by large healthcare organizations.
  when_to_run:
  - Before committing to HITRUST certification
  - 6-12 months before planned assessment
  - When choosing assessment type (e1, i1, r2)
  - During annual recertification preparation
  - After major system or process changes

  - Access to evidence repositories
signals:
  critical:
  - id: HITRUST-CRIT-001
    signal: Core security controls not implemented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No access control policy
    - No encryption for PHI
    - No audit logging
    - No incident response capability
    explanation: |
      HITRUST requires baseline security controls regardless of
      assessment type. Missing core controls prevent certification.
    remediation: |
      1. Implement required security controls
      2. Document control procedures
      3. Collect implementation evidence
      4. Test control effectiveness
      5. Address gaps before assessment
  - id: HITRUST-CRIT-002
    signal: PHI handling not compliant
    evidence_indicators:
    - PHI not encrypted at rest
    - PHI not encrypted in transit
    - Access to PHI not restricted
    - PHI disclosure not tracked
    explanation: |
      Healthcare organizations require HITRUST-certified vendors to
      properly protect PHI. Non-compliance blocks certification.
    remediation: |
      1. Implement PHI encryption
      2. Restrict PHI access
      3. Implement access logging
      4. Create PHI handling procedures
      5. Train personnel on PHI handling
  high:
  - id: HITRUST-HIGH-001
    signal: Evidence collection not systematic
    evidence_indicators:
    - Evidence scattered or missing
    - No evidence repository
    - Cannot demonstrate control operation
    - Evidence not mapped to controls
    explanation: |
      HITRUST assessors require evidence for each control. Systematic
      evidence collection is essential for efficient assessment.
    remediation: |
      1. Map evidence requirements to controls
      2. Establish evidence repository
      3. Collect all required evidence
      4. Maintain evidence currency
      5. Link evidence to MyCSF controls
  - id: HITRUST-HIGH-002
    signal: Third-party risk management inadequate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Vendor inventory incomplete
    - No vendor security assessments
    - BAAs not in place
    - Subcontractor management missing
    explanation: |
      HITRUST requires vendor risk management. Healthcare clients
      expect HITRUST-certified vendors to manage their supply chain.
    remediation: |
      1. Create complete vendor inventory
      2. Assess vendor security risk
      3. Execute BAAs with PHI vendors
      4. Monitor vendor compliance
      5. Document vendor management
  medium:
  - id: HITRUST-MED-001
    signal: Risk assessment not HITRUST-aligned
    evidence_indicators:
    - Risk assessment doesn't cover HITRUST domains
    - Risk factors not properly weighted
    - Control selection not risk-based
    remediation: |
      1. Conduct HITRUST-aligned risk assessment
      2. Use HITRUST risk factors
      3. Map risks to control requirements
      4. Document risk treatment decisions
  positive:
  - id: HITRUST-POS-001
    signal: Prior HITRUST experience exists

    - Previous HITRUST assessment completed
    - MyCSF access maintained
    - Evidence collection established
