description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the mechanisms for enforcing Terms of Service (ToS) including
    acceptable use policies, prohibited conduct detection, enforcement
    processes, user notification, appeals, and consistency of enforcement
    decisions.
  why_it_matters: |
    ToS enforcement protects platform integrity:
    - Prevents abuse that harms other users
    - Limits legal liability
    - Maintains service quality
    - Builds trust through consistent enforcement

    Inconsistent or absent enforcement creates liability and user harm.
  when_to_run:
  - When reviewing trust and safety programs
  - After significant abuse incidents
  - When scaling enforcement operations
  - During legal/compliance reviews
  - When updating Terms of Service
signals:
  critical:
  - id: TOS-CRIT-001
    signal: No enforcement capability for ToS violations
    evidence_indicators:
    - No abuse detection
    - Cannot suspend violating accounts
    - No enforcement processes
    - ToS is aspirational only
    explanation: |
      ToS without enforcement provides no protection. Users violate
      ToS without consequence, creating liability and harm.
    remediation: |
      1. Implement violation detection
      2. Create enforcement processes
      3. Enable account actions
      4. Document enforcement decisions
  - id: TOS-CRIT-002
    signal: Enforcement decisions inconsistent
    evidence_indicators:
    - Similar violations treated differently
    - No enforcement guidelines
    - Arbitrary enforcement
    - User complaints of unfairness
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent enforcement creates legal risk and user distrust.
      Similar violations must receive similar treatment.
    remediation: |
      1. Create enforcement guidelines
      2. Define violation categories
      3. Specify consequences
      4. Train enforcement staff
  high:
  - id: TOS-HIGH-001
    signal: No user notification for enforcement
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users not informed of violations
    - No explanation provided
    - Enforcement is opaque
    - Users cannot understand why actioned
    explanation: |
      Users should understand what they did wrong. Opaque enforcement
      prevents improvement and creates frustration.
    remediation: |
      1. Notify users of violations
      2. Explain specific violation
      3. Provide appeal path
      4. Document notifications
  - id: TOS-HIGH-002
    signal: No appeals process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Enforcement decisions final
    - No review mechanism
    - Users cannot contest errors
    - False positives unaddressed
    explanation: |
      Enforcement errors occur. Without appeals, users have no recourse
      and errors persist. May violate consumer protection requirements.
    remediation: |
      1. Create appeals process
      2. Enable user submission
      3. Review appeals fairly
      4. Document decisions
  medium:
  - id: TOS-MED-001
    signal: Enforcement not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No enforcement records
    - Cannot demonstrate consistency
    - Historical decisions unknown
    remediation: |
      1. Document all enforcement actions
      2. Record rationale
      3. Enable analysis
      4. Support audits
  positive:
  - id: TOS-POS-001
    signal: Fair and transparent enforcement
    evidence_indicators:
    - Consistent enforcement
    - User notification
    - Appeals available
    - Documented decisions
