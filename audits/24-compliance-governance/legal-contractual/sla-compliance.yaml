  what: |
    Evaluates compliance with Service Level Agreements including uptime
    commitments, response time guarantees, support SLAs, and related
    contractual obligations. Assesses measurement methodology, reporting
    accuracy, credit processes, and actual vs committed performance.
  why_it_matters: |
    SLA compliance affects customer relationships and finances:
    - SLA breaches require credits/refunds
    - Repeated breaches damage customer trust
    - Inaccurate measurement creates disputes
    - Customers rely on SLA commitments

    Accurate SLA tracking and compliance protects relationships.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly SLA review
  - After major incidents
  - During customer contract renewals
  - When SLA disputes arise
  - During operations review
signals:
  critical:
  - id: SLA-CRIT-001
    signal: SLA commitments not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No uptime measurement
    - Cannot report SLA status
    - Customer requests unanswerable
    - Compliance unknown
    explanation: |
      Without measurement, you cannot know if SLAs are met. Customers
      expect transparent SLA reporting.
    remediation: |
      1. Implement SLA measurement
      2. Define measurement methodology
      3. Create SLA dashboard
      4. Enable customer reporting

    signal: SLA measurement methodology inappropriate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Measurement doesn't match commitment
    - Exclusions not per contract
    - Measurement favors provider
    - Customer disputes methodology
    explanation: |
      Measurement must align with contract language. Inappropriate
      methodology creates disputes and legal risk.
    remediation: |
      1. Review contract SLA language
      2. Align measurement to contract
      3. Document methodology

    - Breaches not communicated
    - Customer must discover breaches
    - Credit process burdensome
    explanation: |

      3. Communicate to customers
      4. Automate where possible

      2. Provide historical data
      3. Enable self-service reporting
      4. Be transparent about breaches
