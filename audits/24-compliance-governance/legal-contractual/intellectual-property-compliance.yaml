description:
  what: |
    Evaluates intellectual property compliance including ownership of
    developed IP, protection of trade secrets, use of third-party IP,
    patent considerations, and employee/contractor IP agreements.
  why_it_matters: |
    IP compliance protects company assets:
    - Unclear IP ownership creates M&A problems
    - Patent infringement can block products
    - Trade secret exposure damages competitive position
    - Missing assignments can lose IP rights

    Proper IP management protects company value.
  when_to_run:
  - During M&A due diligence
  - Before significant funding rounds
  - When developing patentable technology
  - During annual legal review
  - When engaging contractors
signals:
  critical:
  - id: IP-CRIT-001
    signal: No IP assignment agreements
    evidence_indicators:
    - Employees without IP assignment
    - Contractors own their work
    - IP ownership unclear
    - Work product not assigned
    explanation: |
      Without IP assignment, developers may own what they create.
      This creates ownership disputes and M&A problems.
    remediation: |
      1. Implement IP assignment policy
      2. Execute agreements with all developers
      3. Include in employment agreements
      4. Cover contractors explicitly
  - id: IP-CRIT-002
    signal: Trade secrets not protected
    evidence_indicators:
    - No confidentiality agreements
    - Secrets not identified
    - Unrestricted access
    - No protection measures
    explanation: |
      Trade secrets require protection to maintain legal status.
      Unprotected secrets can lose trade secret protection.
    remediation: |
      1. Identify trade secrets
      2. Implement protection measures
      3. Require confidentiality agreements
      4. Restrict access appropriately
  high:
  - id: IP-HIGH-001
    signal: No IP inventory
    evidence_indicators:
    - Patents not tracked
    - Trademarks not inventoried
    - Trade secrets not cataloged
    - IP assets unknown
    explanation: |
      Without inventory, IP cannot be properly managed, protected,
      or valued. Creates problems for M&A and protection.
    remediation: |
      1. Create IP inventory
      2. Catalog all IP types
      3. Track registration status
      4. Maintain ongoing
  - id: IP-HIGH-002
    signal: Third-party IP use not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - Licensed IP not inventoried
    - License scope unclear
    - Usage may exceed license
    - Dependencies not assessed
    explanation: |
      Using IP beyond license scope creates infringement risk.
      Must understand and comply with third-party IP licenses.
    remediation: |
      1. Inventory licensed IP
      2. Document license scope
      3. Verify compliant use
      4. Track ongoing
  medium:
  - id: IP-MED-001
    signal: No patent review process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Inventions not captured
    - No patent evaluation
    - Potential patents missed
    remediation: |
      1. Create invention capture process
      2. Evaluate patent potential
      3. File where appropriate
      4. Track patent portfolio
  - id: IP-MED-002
    signal: Open source contribution policy missing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Employees contribute without approval
    - Company IP may be released
    - No contribution guidelines
    remediation: |
      1. Create contribution policy
      2. Require approval process
      3. Review for IP disclosure
      4. Educate developers
  positive:
  - id: IP-POS-001
