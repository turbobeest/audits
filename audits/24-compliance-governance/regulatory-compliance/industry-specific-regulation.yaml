  what: |
    Comprehensive audit of industry-specific regulatory compliance beyond
    cross-sector regulations like GDPR or SOX. Identifies and evaluates
    compliance with sector-specific requirements including financial services
    (GLBA, SEC, FINRA, AML/KYC), telecommunications (FCC, TCPA), energy
    (NERC CIP, FERC), insurance (state regulations, NAIC), gaming (state
    gaming commissions), food/beverage (FDA), pharmaceuticals (FDA, HIPAA),
    and other specialized regulatory frameworks. Adapts assessment approach
    based on identified industry classification.
  why_it_matters: |
    Industry-specific regulations carry severe consequences:
    - Regulatory penalties often exceed general privacy fines
    - License revocation can end business operations
    - Industry-specific regulators have specialized expertise
    - Cross-industry expansion requires compliance assessment
    - Many industries have mandatory compliance certification
    - Emerging regulations (AI, crypto, fintech) create new requirements
    - State-level variations add complexity
    - Professional liability and director/officer exposure
  when_to_run:
  - Before entering regulated industry
  - Annual compliance assessment
  - When expanding to new jurisdictions
  - After regulatory changes in industry
  - Before product launches in regulated sectors
  - During M&A due diligence

    evidence_indicators:
    - Licensed activity performed without license
    - Operating in jurisdiction without required registration
    - License expired or revoked
    - Operating outside license scope
    explanation: |
      Most regulated industries require licenses or registrations
      before conducting business. Operating without proper
      authorization is typically a criminal offense in addition
      to civil liability.
    remediation: |
      1. Identify all jurisdictions where business is conducted
      2. Determine license/registration requirements for each
      3. Obtain required licenses before operating
      4. Monitor license renewals and conditions
      5. Implement processes to maintain compliance

    - Consent orders or enforcement actions in effect
    - Repeat findings in subsequent examinations
    explanation: |
      Regulatory examination findings must be addressed promptly.
      Failure to remediate can result in escalating enforcement
      action including cease and desist orders, fines, and
      license revocation.
    remediation: |
      1. Inventory all open examination findings
      2. Create remediation plans with timelines
      3. Allocate resources for remediation
      4. Report remediation progress to regulators

      scrutiny in most regulated industries.
    remediation: |
      1. Inventory all required regulatory filings
      2. Create filing calendar with deadlines
      3. Assign responsibility for each filing
      4. Implement tracking and reminder systems

      1. Appoint qualified compliance officer
      2. Document comprehensive compliance policies
      3. Implement regulatory change monitoring
      4. Create industry-specific training program

    - Required formats not used
    explanation: |
      Regulated industries often have specific recordkeeping
      requirements including retention periods, formats, and
      accessibility for regulatory examination.
    remediation: |

      responsible for compliance regardless of outsourcing.
    remediation: |
      1. Inventory all third-party service providers
      2. Risk-rate vendors based on criticality
      3. Conduct appropriate due diligence

      have specific change management requirements for systems
      affecting regulatory compliance.
    remediation: |
      1. Review industry change management requirements
      2. Implement required approval processes
      3. Document impact assessments
      4. Maintain testing evidence
      5. Document rollback procedures
