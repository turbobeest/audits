description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the vendor security assessment process including questionnaires,
    certification review, penetration test review, and risk evaluation.
    Assesses whether assessments are proportional to risk, consistently
    applied, and effectively identify vendor security gaps.
  why_it_matters: |
    Vendor security assessments are the primary mechanism for evaluating
    third-party risk:
    - Identify security gaps before sharing data
    - Validate vendor security claims
    - Meet customer and regulatory expectations
    - Enable informed risk acceptance decisions

    Effective assessment prevents vendor-related incidents.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing vendor assessment program
  - During vendor management program review
  - When assessment effectiveness questioned
  - Before critical vendor onboarding
  - During compliance assessments
signals:
  critical:
  - id: VENDORSEC-CRIT-001
    signal: No security assessment performed for high-risk vendors
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical vendors not assessed
    - Data-handling vendors unreviewed
    - Security assumed without verification
    - No assessment process exists
    explanation: |
      High-risk vendors require security assessment. Assuming security
      without verification creates significant risk exposure.
    remediation: |
      1. Define vendor risk tiers
      2. Require assessment for high-risk
      3. Implement assessment process
      4. Document all assessments
  - id: VENDORSEC-CRIT-002
    signal: Assessment findings not actioned
    evidence_indicators:
    - Risks identified but ignored
    - No risk acceptance process
    - Findings not tracked
    - Critical gaps not addressed
    explanation: |
      Assessments that don't drive action provide false assurance.
      Findings must lead to risk decisions and mitigations.
    remediation: |
      1. Track all assessment findings
      2. Require risk acceptance for gaps
      3. Define acceptable risk criteria
      4. Follow up on remediation
  high:
  - id: VENDORSEC-HIGH-001
    signal: Assessments not risk-proportional
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same assessment for all vendors
    - Critical vendors under-assessed
    - Low-risk vendors over-assessed
    - No tiering approach
    explanation: |
      Assessment effort should match risk. Flat approaches waste
      resources or leave high-risk vendors under-assessed.
    remediation: |
      1. Define risk-based tiers
      2. Match assessment depth to risk
      3. Focus resources on high-risk
      4. Simplify low-risk assessment
  - id: VENDORSEC-HIGH-002
    signal: No reassessment of existing vendors
    evidence_indicators:
    - One-time assessment only
    - No periodic review
    - Long-term vendors never reassessed
    - Changes not evaluated
    explanation: |
      Vendor security changes over time. Without reassessment,
      initial assessment loses validity.
    remediation: |
      1. Define reassessment frequency by risk
      2. Conduct annual reassessment for critical
      3. Reassess on significant changes
      4. Track reassessment completion
  medium:
  - id: VENDORSEC-MED-001
    signal: Assessment criteria inconsistent
    evidence_indicators:
    - No standard questionnaire
    - Different questions per vendor
    - Assessor discretion too high
    - Results not comparable
    remediation: |
      1. Standardize questionnaire
      2. Define evaluation criteria
      3. Train assessors
      4. Enable comparison
  positive:
  - id: VENDORSEC-POS-001
    signal: Risk-based assessment program
    evidence_indicators:
    - Tiered assessment approach
    - Proportional to risk
    - Findings actioned
    - Periodic reassessment
