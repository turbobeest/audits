description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the vendor risk management program for compliance with security
    and regulatory requirements. Assesses vendor inventory completeness, risk
    assessment processes, security review procedures, ongoing monitoring, and
    compliance evidence collection from vendors.
  why_it_matters: |
    Vendor risk is organizational risk:
    - 60% of data breaches involve third parties
    - Regulatory frameworks require vendor management (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR)
    - Customers assess your vendor management as part of their due diligence
    - Vendor failures can disrupt operations and damage reputation

    Effective vendor compliance management is essential for compliance and
    risk management.
  when_to_run:
  - During compliance program assessments
  - Before adding critical vendors
  - When regulations require vendor management
  - After vendor security incidents
  - During annual compliance reviews
signals:
  critical:
  - id: VENDOR-CRIT-001
    signal: No vendor inventory exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot list all vendors
    - No central vendor registry
    - Unknown data sharing with vendors
    - Shadow IT vendors untracked
    explanation: |
      Without knowing your vendors, you cannot assess or manage vendor risk.
      This is a fundamental compliance gap.
    remediation: |
      1. Create comprehensive vendor inventory
      2. Include all service providers and tools
      3. Classify by data access and criticality
      4. Update inventory with procurement
      5. Conduct shadow IT discovery
  - id: VENDOR-CRIT-002
    signal: No vendor security assessment process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Vendors not assessed for security
    - No security questionnaires sent
    - No SOC 2/certifications reviewed
    - Security not part of vendor selection
    explanation: |
      Without security assessment, you may be sharing data with insecure
      vendors. Regulators and customers expect vendor assessment.
    remediation: |
      1. Implement vendor security assessment
      2. Use security questionnaires
      3. Require security certifications
      4. Include security in procurement
      5. Document assessment results
  high:
  - id: VENDOR-HIGH-001
    signal: Critical vendors not monitored ongoing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Initial assessment only
    - No annual reassessment
    - Vendor incidents not tracked
    - Certification expiry not monitored
    explanation: |
      Vendor security can degrade over time. Ongoing monitoring ensures
      continued compliance and early incident awareness.
    remediation: |
      1. Establish monitoring frequency by risk
      2. Conduct annual reassessments
      3. Monitor vendor security news
      4. Track certification currency
      5. Respond to vendor incidents
  - id: VENDOR-HIGH-002
    signal: Vendor compliance evidence not collected
    evidence_indicators:
    - No SOC 2 reports from vendors
    - No certifications on file
    - Cannot demonstrate vendor compliance
    - Evidence requests not systematic
    explanation: |
      Auditors expect evidence of vendor security. Without collected
      evidence, you cannot demonstrate compliance.
    remediation: |
      1. Request compliance evidence from vendors
      2. Collect SOC 2, ISO certifications
      3. Review vendor reports
      4. Document review findings
      5. Store evidence systematically
  medium:
  - id: VENDOR-MED-001
    signal: Vendor risk tiering not implemented
    evidence_indicators:
    - All vendors treated equally
    - No criticality classification
    - Resources not prioritized
    remediation: |
      1. Define vendor risk tiers
      2. Classify vendors by data access/criticality
      3. Apply proportional assessment
      4. Prioritize high-risk vendors
  - id: VENDOR-MED-002
    signal: No vendor termination process
    evidence_indicators:
    - No offboarding procedures
    - Data return/deletion unclear
    - Access not revoked systematically
    remediation: |
      1. Create vendor termination process
      2. Define data return requirements
      3. Verify access revocation
      4. Document termination completion
  positive:
  - id: VENDOR-POS-001

    evidence_indicators:
    - Complete vendor inventory
    - Risk-based assessment
    - Ongoing monitoring
    - Evidence systematically collected
