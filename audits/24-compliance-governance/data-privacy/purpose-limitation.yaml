description:
  what: |
    Assesses whether personal data is collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes
    and not further processed in ways incompatible with those purposes. Reviews privacy notices,
    data flows, and actual processing operations for purpose alignment.
  why_it_matters: |
    GDPR Article 5(1)(b) mandates purpose limitation. Using data for undisclosed purposes erodes
    user trust and violates regulatory requirements. Purpose creep is a common compliance failure
    that leads to enforcement actions and reputational damage.
  when_to_run:
  - When introducing new data processing activities
  - During privacy notice updates
  - Quarterly compliance assessments
signals:
  critical:
  - id: PURPLIM-CRIT-001
    signal: Data used for purposes not disclosed in privacy notice
    remediation: Either cease processing or update privacy notice and obtain new consent
  - id: PURPLIM-CRIT-002
    signal: No documented purposes for data processing activities
    remediation: Document specific purposes for all processing operations
  high:
  - id: PURPLIM-HIGH-001
    signal: Purposes stated too broadly (e.g., 'business operations')
    remediation: Refine purpose statements to be specific and explicit
  - id: PURPLIM-HIGH-002
    signal: Secondary processing without compatibility assessment
    remediation: Conduct compatibility assessment for all secondary uses
  medium:
  - id: PURPLIM-MED-001
    signal: Purpose documentation scattered across multiple systems
    remediation: Centralize purpose documentation in records of processing
  - id: PURPLIM-MED-002
    signal: Analytics processing without clear purpose boundaries
    remediation: Define and document specific analytics purposes
