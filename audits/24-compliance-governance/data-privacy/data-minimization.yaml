description:
  what: |
    Evaluates whether the organization collects and processes only the minimum personal data
    necessary for specified purposes. Assesses data collection forms, database schemas,
    and processing operations against stated purposes to identify excessive data collection.
  why_it_matters: |
    GDPR Article 5(1)(c) requires data minimization as a core principle. Collecting excessive
    data increases breach risk, storage costs, and regulatory liability. Organizations face
    fines up to 4% of global revenue for violations.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching new data collection features
  - During annual privacy compliance reviews
  - After data mapping exercises identify new data flows
signals:
  critical:
  - id: DATAMIN-CRIT-001
    signal: Collecting sensitive data categories without documented necessity
    remediation: Document lawful basis for each sensitive data field or remove collection
  - id: DATAMIN-CRIT-002
    signal: No data inventory mapping fields to processing purposes
    remediation: Create comprehensive data inventory linking each field to specific purposes
  high:
  - id: DATAMIN-HIGH-001
    signal: Optional fields stored as required in database schemas
    remediation: Review schema constraints and align with actual necessity
  - id: DATAMIN-HIGH-002
    signal: Collecting full datasets when aggregated data would suffice
    remediation: Implement data aggregation at collection point where appropriate
  medium:
  - id: DATAMIN-MED-001
    signal: Form fields collecting more precision than needed (e.g., full DOB vs. age range)
    remediation: Reduce data precision to minimum required for purpose
  - id: DATAMIN-MED-002
    signal: Legacy fields still collected but no longer used
    remediation: Audit and remove deprecated data collection fields
