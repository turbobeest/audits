description:
  what: |
    Reviews test naming conventions for consistency and clarity. Evaluates
    whether test names clearly describe the scenario being tested, the
    expected behavior, and any conditions. Checks for patterns like
    "should...", "when...then...", or "given...when...then..." formats.
  why_it_matters: |
    Clear test names serve as documentation and make test failures
    immediately understandable. Poor test names require reading the test
    code to understand what's being verified, slowing down debugging and
    maintenance. Consistent naming makes the test suite navigable.
  when_to_run:
  - Code review of new tests
  - Test suite maintenance reviews
  - Onboarding new team members
  - Documentation improvements

signals:
  critical:
  - id: NAMING-CRIT-001
    signal: Test names are empty or numeric (test1, test2)
    evidence_pattern: test\('test\d+'\) or empty test descriptions
    explanation: |
      Meaningless test names provide no information about what's being
      tested. Failures require reading the entire test to understand.
    remediation: Rename all tests to describe behavior being verified
  - id: NAMING-CRIT-002
    signal: Test names don't describe expected behavior
    evidence_pattern: Test names that only describe input, not outcome
    explanation: |
      Tests should describe what should happen, not just what is done.
      "test add function" is worse than "should return sum of two numbers".
    remediation: Rewrite test names to include expected behavior
  high:
  - id: NAMING-HIGH-001
    signal: Inconsistent naming patterns across test suite
    evidence_pattern: Mixed should/when/test patterns
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent patterns make the test suite harder to navigate
      and create cognitive overhead when reading or writing tests.
    remediation: Adopt and enforce a consistent naming convention
  - id: NAMING-HIGH-002
    signal: Test names are implementation-focused
    evidence_pattern: Names reference internal methods/variables
    explanation: |
      Implementation-focused names break when code is refactored
      and don't communicate the user-facing behavior being tested.
    remediation: Rewrite names to focus on behavior, not implementation
  medium:
  - id: NAMING-MED-001
    signal: Describe blocks don't organize tests logically
    evidence_pattern: Flat test structure without grouping
    remediation: Use nested describe blocks to group related tests
  - id: NAMING-MED-002
    signal: Test names are overly verbose
    evidence_pattern: Test names >100 characters
    remediation: Use describe blocks for context, shorter it/test names
  low:
  - id: NAMING-LOW-001
    signal: Minor inconsistencies in capitalization/style
    evidence_pattern: Mixed sentence case and title case
  positive:
  - id: NAMING-POS-001
    signal: Consistent BDD-style naming throughout
    evidence_pattern: All tests use should/when/given patterns
  - id: NAMING-POS-002
    signal: Tests organized in logical describe hierarchies
    evidence_pattern: Nested describes group related functionality
