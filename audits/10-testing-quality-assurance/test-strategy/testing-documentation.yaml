description:
  what: |
    Reviews testing documentation including test plans, test case descriptions,
    testing guidelines, contribution guides for tests, and documentation
    explaining how to run and maintain the test suite. Evaluates whether
    new team members can understand and contribute to testing effectively.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor testing documentation leads to inconsistent testing practices,
    difficulty onboarding new team members, and test suite degradation over
    time. Good documentation enables teams to maintain high testing standards
    and makes the test suite a valuable engineering asset rather than a burden.
  when_to_run:
  - Team onboarding preparation
  - Test suite maintenance reviews
  - Knowledge transfer activities
  - After test suite refactoring

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DOC-CRIT-001
    signal: No documentation on how to run tests
    evidence_pattern: README lacks test execution instructions
    explanation: |
      Without run instructions, new developers cannot execute tests,
      leading to commits without test verification and broken builds.
    remediation: Add clear test execution instructions to README
  - id: DOC-CRIT-002
    signal: No guidance on writing new tests
    evidence_pattern: No CONTRIBUTING guide or test writing documentation
    explanation: |
      Without test writing guidance, new tests will be inconsistent,
      potentially of low quality, and may not follow team conventions.
    remediation: Document test patterns, conventions, and examples
  high:
  - id: DOC-HIGH-001
    signal: Test organization not documented
    evidence_pattern: No explanation of test directory structure
    explanation: |
      Unclear organization makes it difficult to find relevant tests
      and leads to duplicate or misplaced test files.
    remediation: Document test directory structure and organization principles
  - id: DOC-HIGH-002
    signal: No documentation on test data management
    evidence_pattern: Fixtures/factories undocumented
    explanation: |
      Test data management is crucial for test reliability. Without
      documentation, developers may create conflicting or brittle test data.
    remediation: Document test data patterns, fixtures, and factories
  medium:
  - id: DOC-MED-001
    signal: Test utilities and helpers undocumented
    evidence_pattern: Helper functions exist without JSDoc or README
    remediation: Add documentation for shared test utilities
  - id: DOC-MED-002
    signal: No troubleshooting guide for test failures
    evidence_pattern: Missing FAQ or troubleshooting documentation
    remediation: Document common test failures and their resolutions
  low:
  - id: DOC-LOW-001
    signal: Test descriptions are vague or missing
    evidence_pattern: Test names don't describe expected behavior
  positive:
  - id: DOC-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive testing guide exists
    evidence_pattern: Dedicated TESTING.md or docs/testing directory
  - id: DOC-POS-002
    signal: Tests are self-documenting with clear descriptions
    evidence_pattern: BDD-style test descriptions throughout
