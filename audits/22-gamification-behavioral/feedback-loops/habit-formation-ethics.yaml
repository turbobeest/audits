description:
  what: |
    Comprehensive ethical assessment of habit-forming mechanisms,
    distinguishing between persuasion that helps users achieve their
    goals and coercion that manipulates behavior for business metrics.
    Evaluates the line between helpful habit support and exploitation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Ethical habit formation:
    - Helps users build habits they actually want
    - Supports user-defined goals
    - Respects user autonomy
    - Creates genuine value

    Exploitative habit formation:
    - Manufactures habits users don't want
    - Serves business goals over user goals
    - Manipulates psychological vulnerabilities
    - Creates dependency without value
  when_to_run:
  - When designing habit-forming features
  - During ethical reviews
  - After concerns about manipulation
  - When evaluating engagement strategy ethics

    questions:
    - What habits are you trying to form in users?
    - Do users want to form these habits?
    - How do habit features serve user goals vs. business goals?
    - Where do you draw ethical lines in habit design?

    purpose: Understand habit strategy and ethics
    duration: 45 min
  - role: Product Designer
    questions:
    - Describe the habit loops in the product
    - How do you trigger habit formation?
    - What makes users return - value or compulsion?
    - What safeguards exist against unhealthy habits?
    - How do you distinguish persuasion from manipulation?
    purpose: Understand design approach
    duration: 45 min
  - role: User Researcher
    questions:
    - Do users describe their usage as a healthy habit?
    - Do users feel manipulated or served?
    - Would users recommend the habit to others?
    - Are there regrets about habit formation?
    - Do habits align with user-stated goals?
    purpose: Assess user experience of habits

signals:
  critical:
  - id: HBTFM-CRIT-001
    signal: Habit formation targets psychological vulnerabilities
    evidence_indicators:
    - Design docs reference exploiting vulnerabilities
    - Variable rewards mimic gambling mechanics
    - Triggers target addiction-prone behaviors
    - Vulnerable populations deliberately targeted
    explanation: |
      Deliberately exploiting psychological vulnerabilities
      crosses from persuasion into manipulation.
    remediation: |
      - Remove exploitative mechanics
      - Add protections for vulnerable users
      - Redesign for user value not compulsion
      - Establish ethical boundaries
  - id: HBTFM-CRIT-002
    signal: Habits formed without user consent or awareness
    evidence_indicators:
    - Hidden behavior shaping
    - Users unaware of manipulation techniques
    - No transparency about habit formation goals
    - Dark patterns in habit triggers
    explanation: |
      Forming habits without user awareness violates
      autonomy and informed consent.
    remediation: |
      - Disclose habit-forming intent
      - Give users control over habit features
      - Remove hidden manipulation
      - Respect user agency
  - id: HBTFM-CRIT-003
    signal: Habits serve business not users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Habit value to user unclear or absent
    - Business metrics sole success measure
    - Users would not choose these habits
    - Habits persist despite user attempts to stop
    explanation: |
      Creating habits that serve only business goals
      extracts value without providing it.
    remediation: |
      - Align habits with user goals
      - Ensure clear user value
      - Allow easy habit disruption
      - Measure user benefit not just retention
  high:
  - id: HBTFM-HIGH-001
    signal: No consideration of habit health
    evidence_indicators:
    - No assessment of habit impact on users
    - Unhealthy usage patterns ignored
    - No limits or controls on habit features
    - Quantity valued over quality
    explanation: |
      Forming habits without considering their impact
      can create unhealthy patterns.
    remediation: |
      - Assess habit health impact
      - Add usage controls
      - Monitor for unhealthy patterns
      - Design for healthy habits
  - id: HBTFM-HIGH-002
    signal: Triggers use dark patterns
    evidence_indicators:
    - False urgency in notifications
    - Social pressure manipulation
    - FOMO-based triggers
    - Guilt or shame as motivators
    explanation: |
      Dark pattern triggers manipulate rather than
      genuinely remind or motivate.
    remediation: |
      - Remove dark patterns from triggers
      - Use honest, helpful reminders
      - Respect user attention
      - Support genuine motivation
  medium:
  - id: HBTFM-MED-001
    signal: Habit features difficult to disable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Notification controls hard to find
    - Opt-out process complex
    - Habits persist despite user preference
    - Friction to disable vs. enable
    remediation: |
      - Make habit controls easy to access
      - Respect user opt-out choices
      - Equal friction for enable and disable
      - Honor user preferences
  - id: HBTFM-MED-002
    signal: No user control over habit intensity
    evidence_indicators:
    - One-size-fits-all habit approach
    - No frequency controls
    - Users cannot reduce triggers
    - No customization options
    remediation: |
      - Allow intensity customization
      - Provide frequency controls
      - Let users set their own goals
      - Support individual preferences
