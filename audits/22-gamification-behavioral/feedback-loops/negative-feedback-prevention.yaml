  what: |
    Assesses how the system prevents and handles negative feedback
    loops that can spiral into user frustration, abandonment, or
    learned helplessness. Evaluates error handling, recovery
    mechanisms, and prevention of frustrating cascades.
  why_it_matters: |
    Negative feedback loop prevention:
    - Helps users recover from errors gracefully
    - Prevents frustration spirals
    - Maintains user confidence and motivation
    - Supports continued engagement through difficulties

    Poor negative feedback handling:
    - Creates frustration and abandonment
    - Leads to learned helplessness
    - Punishes users for trying
    - Destroys motivation and confidence
  when_to_run:
  - When designing error handling
  - After user frustration or abandonment complaints
  - During difficulty tuning
  - When evaluating onboarding and learning curves

signals:
  critical:
  - id: NEGFB-CRIT-001
    signal: System creates punishing spirals with no recovery
    evidence_indicators:
    - Failures lead to more failures systematically
    - No adaptive difficulty or assistance
    - Users cannot recover from setbacks
    - Significant user loss at difficulty spikes
    explanation: |
      When failure leads to more failure without recovery paths,
      users experience learned helplessness and abandon the system.
    remediation: |
      - Add recovery mechanics after failure
      - Implement adaptive difficulty
      - Provide assistance when users struggle
      - Create paths back from setbacks
  - id: NEGFB-CRIT-002
    signal: Error handling blames or punishes users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Error messages shame users
    - Penalties for user mistakes
    - No guidance for recovery
    - Users feel stupid or incompetent
    explanation: |
      Blaming users for errors destroys confidence and
      creates negative associations with the product.
    remediation: |
      - Reframe errors as system issues
      - Remove blame from messaging
      - Provide clear recovery guidance
      - Support user confidence
  high:
  - id: NEGFB-HIGH-001
    signal: Difficulty spikes cause mass abandonment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Sharp drop-offs at specific points
    - Difficulty jumps without preparation
    - No skill building before challenges
    - Users feel overwhelmed suddenly
    explanation: |
      Unprepared difficulty spikes lose users who were
      otherwise engaged.
    remediation: |
      - Smooth difficulty curves
      - Build skills before challenges
      - Add optional easier paths
      - Detect and assist struggling users
  - id: NEGFB-HIGH-002
    signal: Errors provide no actionable guidance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Generic error messages
    - No explanation of what went wrong
    - No guidance on how to succeed
    - Users must guess at solutions
    explanation: |
      Unhelpful error messages leave users frustrated
      without a path forward.
    remediation: |
      - Explain errors in user terms
      - Provide specific guidance
      - Offer alternative approaches
      - Link to help resources
  medium:
  - id: NEGFB-MED-001
    signal: Negative feedback too frequent or harsh
    evidence_indicators:
    - Constant negative signals
    - Harsh language or visuals for failures
    - Negative feedback outweighs positive
    - Users feel constantly criticized
    remediation: |
      - Balance negative with positive feedback
      - Use gentle language for corrections
      - Celebrate progress alongside failures
      - Maintain encouraging tone
  - id: NEGFB-MED-002
    signal: No detection of struggling users
    evidence_indicators:
    - No monitoring for frustration signals
    - Struggling users not identified
    - No proactive assistance offered
    - Users must seek help themselves
    remediation: |
      - Implement struggle detection
      - Offer proactive assistance
      - Monitor for frustration patterns
      - Intervene before abandonment
  low:
  - id: NEGFB-LOW-001
    signal: Timing of negative feedback suboptimal

    remediation: |
      - Provide immediate, contextual feedback
      - Time feedback for minimal disruption
      - Help users learn from errors quickly
  positive:
  - id: NEGFB-POS-001
