  what: |
    Assesses positive feedback loop design for user engagement,
    evaluating whether reinforcement patterns create genuine value
    or exploit psychological mechanisms for metrics. Examines the
    balance between motivating feedback and compulsive patterns.
  why_it_matters: |
    Well-designed positive feedback loops:
    - Reinforce meaningful user achievements
    - Create satisfying interactions
    - Build healthy engagement patterns
    - Support user goals and autonomy

    Poorly designed positive feedback loops:
    - Create compulsive checking behavior
    - Exploit dopamine responses for engagement
    - Prioritize metrics over user wellbeing
    - Lead to addiction-like patterns
  when_to_run:
  - When designing core feedback systems
  - After engagement seems compulsive not satisfying
  - During ethical reviews of gamification
  - When evaluating notification and reward systems

  interviews:
  - role: Product Designer
    questions:
    - What positive feedback mechanisms exist?
    - How do you decide when to provide feedback?
    - What user goals does the feedback reinforce?
    - How do you balance engagement with wellbeing?
    - What safeguards prevent feedback from becoming compulsive?
    purpose: Understand feedback design philosophy
    duration: 45 min
  - role: Data Analyst
    questions:
    - What patterns exist around feedback events?
    - Do users exhibit compulsive checking behavior?
    - How does feedback affect session length and frequency?
    - Are there signs of unhealthy engagement patterns?
    purpose: Identify behavioral patterns
    duration: 30 min
  - role: User Researcher
    questions:
    - How do users describe the feedback they receive?
    - Does feedback feel meaningful or manipulative?
    - Do users feel satisfied or anxious after feedback?
    - Is feedback aligned with what users value?
    purpose: Assess user perception
    duration: 30 min

signals:
  critical:
  - id: POSFB-CRIT-001
    signal: Feedback designed to exploit dopamine responses
    evidence_indicators:
    - Design docs cite addiction research
    - Variable reward schedules central to feedback
    - Feedback optimized for checking behavior
    - Metrics prioritize engagement over satisfaction
    explanation: |
      Deliberately exploiting dopamine responses for engagement
      prioritizes metrics over user wellbeing.
    remediation: |
      - Redesign for satisfaction not compulsion
      - Reduce variable reward intensity
      - Add controls for feedback frequency
      - Measure satisfaction alongside engagement
  - id: POSFB-CRIT-002
    signal: Feedback creates documented compulsive behavior
    evidence_indicators:
    - Significant users show compulsive checking
    - Users report inability to stop checking
    - Feedback withdrawal causes anxiety
    - Life impacts from checking behavior
    explanation: |
      Observable compulsive patterns indicate feedback design
      is causing psychological harm.
    remediation: |
      - Implement feedback batching
      - Add checking frequency controls
      - Reduce urgency signals
      - Provide usage insights to users
  high:
  - id: POSFB-HIGH-001
    signal: Feedback triggers are primarily variable/unpredictable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Random timing for feedback
    - Unpredictable reward amounts
    - Slot machine-like mechanics
    - Users can't predict feedback timing
    explanation: |
      Variable reinforcement creates stronger compulsive behavior
      than predictable feedback.
    remediation: |
      - Add predictable feedback patterns
      - Reduce variability in rewards
      - Provide schedules users can understand
      - Balance variable with fixed feedback
  - id: POSFB-HIGH-002
    signal: Feedback frequency optimized for metrics not users
    evidence_indicators:
    - High-frequency feedback for engagement
    - No user control over feedback volume
    - A/B tests optimize for checking frequency
    - User preference not considered
    explanation: |
      Optimizing feedback for engagement metrics rather than
      user preferences disrespects user autonomy.
    remediation: |
      - Give users control over feedback frequency
      - Optimize for satisfaction not just engagement
      - Respect user preferences
      - Test for wellbeing not just metrics
  medium:
  - id: POSFB-MED-001
    signal: Feedback not aligned with meaningful achievements
    evidence_indicators:
    - Feedback for trivial actions
    - Inflation of positive signals
    - Feedback feels empty or meaningless
    - Disconnected from user goals
    remediation: |
      - Reserve feedback for meaningful achievements
      - Connect feedback to user goals
      - Ensure feedback feels earned
      - Reduce feedback inflation
  - id: POSFB-MED-002
    signal: Feedback delivery creates urgency unnecessarily
    evidence_indicators:
    - Push notifications for non-urgent feedback
    - Visual urgency cues
    - FOMO language in feedback
    - Time pressure around feedback
    remediation: |
      - Remove false urgency from feedback
      - Make feedback available without pressure
      - Use calm notification patterns
      - Respect user attention
  positive:
  - id: POSFB-POS-001
    signal: Feedback reinforces meaningful achievements respectfully
    evidence_indicators:
    - Feedback tied to genuine accomplishments
    - User control over feedback preferences
    - Users feel satisfied not compelled
    - Predictable and meaningful patterns
