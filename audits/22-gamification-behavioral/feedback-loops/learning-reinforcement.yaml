  what: |
    Assesses how feedback mechanisms support effective learning
    and skill development. Evaluates reinforcement timing, spacing,
    retrieval practice, and transfer of learning to ensure users
    genuinely develop competence.
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective learning reinforcement:
    - Builds genuine user competence
    - Creates lasting skill development
    - Optimizes for actual learning not just metrics
    - Uses evidence-based learning science

    Poor learning reinforcement:
    - Creates illusion of learning without retention
    - Optimizes for engagement over skill development
    - Ignores spacing and retrieval effects
    - Measures progress not actual learning
  when_to_run:
  - When designing educational or skill-building features
  - After concerns about learning effectiveness
  - During instructional design reviews
  - When evaluating onboarding and tutorials

signals:
  critical:
  - id: LRNRF-CRIT-001
    signal: Learning metrics measure completion not competence
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progress measured by content viewed
    - No assessment of actual learning
    - Completion rates prioritized over retention
    - Users report not retaining material
    explanation: |
      Measuring completion instead of competence creates
      the illusion of learning without actual skill development.
    remediation: |
      - Add competence-based assessments
      - Track retention over time
      - Measure skill application
      - Focus on learning outcomes not consumption
  - id: LRNRF-CRIT-002
    signal: No spacing or retrieval practice in learning design
    evidence_indicators:
    - All content in single sessions
    - No scheduled review
    - Passive consumption only
    - No retrieval opportunities
    explanation: |
      Without spaced practice and retrieval, learning decays
      rapidly according to well-established research.
    remediation: |
      - Implement spaced repetition
      - Add retrieval practice
      - Schedule review sessions
      - Create active recall opportunities
  high:
  - id: LRNRF-HIGH-001
    signal: Feedback doesn't support error correction
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only right/wrong feedback
    - No explanation of correct answers
    - Users can't learn from mistakes
    - Errors not used for learning
    explanation: |
      Effective learning requires understanding why answers
      are wrong, not just that they are wrong.
    remediation: |
      - Explain correct answers
      - Help users understand errors
      - Provide elaborative feedback
      - Turn mistakes into learning opportunities
  - id: LRNRF-HIGH-002
    signal: Gamification undermines learning goals
    evidence_indicators:
    - Points/badges prioritized over skill
    - Users game the system instead of learning
    - Extrinsic rewards crowd out intrinsic motivation
    - Leaderboards encourage speed over mastery
    explanation: |
      Poorly designed gamification can undermine actual
      learning by shifting focus to game mechanics.
    remediation: |
      - Align gamification with learning goals
      - Reward mastery not speed
      - Balance extrinsic and intrinsic motivation
      - Focus on competence not points
  medium:
  - id: LRNRF-MED-001
    signal: Feedback timing not optimized for learning
    evidence_indicators:
    - Delayed feedback when immediate would help
    - Immediate feedback when delay would benefit
    - No consideration of feedback timing
    remediation: |
      - Provide immediate feedback for procedural learning
      - Consider delayed feedback for conceptual learning
      - Optimize timing for learning outcomes
  - id: LRNRF-MED-002
    signal: Learning difficulty not well calibrated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Content too easy or too hard
    - No adaptive difficulty
    - Users bored or frustrated
    - Not in zone of proximal development
    remediation: |
      - Implement adaptive difficulty
      - Keep users appropriately challenged
      - Calibrate to individual skill levels
      - Provide scaffolding and fading
  positive:
  - id: LRNRF-POS-001
    signal: Evidence-based learning reinforcement
    evidence_indicators:
    - Spaced practice implemented
    - Retrieval practice central
    - Competence-based assessment
    - Users demonstrate skill retention
