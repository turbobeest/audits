  what: |
    Assesses badge and achievement systems evaluating whether they
    recognize genuine accomplishment, provide meaningful motivation,
    and avoid trivial or manipulative patterns that devalue recognition.
  why_it_matters: |
    Well-designed achievements:
    - Recognize genuine accomplishment
    - Create memorable milestones
    - Guide discovery of features or content
    - Provide collection motivation
    - Build user identity and status

    Poorly designed achievements:
    - Trivialize accomplishment through inflation
    - Create meaningless busy work
    - Manipulate through false status
    - Overwhelm with notification spam
    - Fail to create lasting satisfaction
  when_to_run:
  - When designing achievement systems
  - After feedback about achievement fatigue
  - When achievements feel meaningless
  - During gamification ethics reviews

    questions:
    - What is the philosophy behind achievements?
    - How do you decide what deserves an achievement?
    - How do you prevent achievement inflation?
    - What makes achievements feel meaningful?
    purpose: Understand achievement design philosophy
    duration: 30 min
  - role: User Researcher

    - How do users perceive achievements?
    - Which achievements feel most meaningful?
    - Is there achievement fatigue?
    - Do achievements motivate continued engagement?
    purpose: Assess user experience
    duration: 30 min

    purpose: Understand achievement design
    look_for:
    - Achievement criteria and difficulty
    - Reward value and recognition
    - Achievement distribution and pacing
  - type: User feedback
    purpose: Assess perception
    look_for:
    - Satisfaction with achievements
    - Meaningfulness of recognition
    - Achievement fatigue indicators

signals:
  critical:
  - id: BDGAC-CRIT-001
    signal: Achievements designed primarily for engagement manipulation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Achievements for trivial actions
    - Achievements awarded constantly for retention
    - Design docs cite engagement manipulation
    - Users describe achievements as noise
    explanation: |
      When achievements exist for manipulation rather than
      recognition, they become meaningless and annoying.
    remediation: |
      - Reserve achievements for genuine accomplishments
      - Reduce frequency to increase meaning
      - Focus on recognition not manipulation
  high:
  - id: BDGAC-HIGH-001
    signal: Achievement inflation devaluing recognition
    evidence_indicators:
    - Hundreds of trivial achievements
    - Achievements awarded for basic actions
    - No hierarchy of achievement significance
    - Users ignore achievement notifications
    explanation: |
      When everything is an achievement, nothing is. Inflation
      destroys the value of genuine accomplishment.
    remediation: |
      - Consolidate or remove trivial achievements
      - Create clear hierarchy of significance
      - Make achievements feel earned
  - id: BDGAC-HIGH-002
    signal: Achievements require unhealthy behavior
    evidence_indicators:
    - Achievements for extreme time investment
    - Encouraging obsessive completion
    - Achievements for consecutive day requirements
    - Health or wellbeing-compromising requirements
    explanation: |
      Achievements that encourage unhealthy behavior prioritize
      engagement over user welfare.
    remediation: |
      - Remove unhealthy achievement requirements
      - Design achievements respecting user time
      - Avoid streak-based achievements
  medium:
  - id: BDGAC-MED-001
    signal: Achievements lack variety or creativity
    evidence_indicators:
    - Mostly count-based achievements
    - No achievements for exploration or creativity
    - Repetitive achievement patterns
    remediation: |
      - Add variety in achievement types
      - Include exploration and discovery achievements
      - Recognize different play styles
  - id: BDGAC-MED-002
    signal: Achievement rewards don't match effort
    evidence_indicators:
    - Difficult achievements have weak rewards
    - Easy achievements have good rewards
    - No clear reward scaling
    remediation: |
      - Scale rewards with achievement difficulty
      - Make difficult achievements feel worthwhile
  low:
  - id: BDGAC-LOW-001
    signal: Achievement satisfaction not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No user research on achievements
    - Only completion rates tracked
    remediation: |
      - Research user achievement satisfaction
      - Track meaningfulness alongside completion
  positive:
  - id: BDGAC-POS-001
    signal: Meaningful achievements recognizing genuine accomplishment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Achievements feel earned
    - Users value and remember achievements
    - Clear hierarchy of significance
    - Variety in achievement types
