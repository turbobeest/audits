  what: |
    Assesses the difficulty progression of achievements evaluating
    whether they provide appropriate challenge, support skill
    development, and maintain engagement across player skill levels.
  why_it_matters: |
    Well-designed difficulty curves:
    - Match challenge to player skill
    - Provide achievable goals that grow with ability
    - Maintain flow state through appropriate challenge
    - Support mastery development

    Poor difficulty design:
    - Trivial early achievements that don't satisfy
    - Impossible late achievements that frustrate
    - Gaps between achievement tiers
    - Difficulty that doesn't match skill progression
  when_to_run:
  - When designing achievement difficulty
  - After feedback about frustrating achievements
  - When achievement completion rates indicate issues
  - During achievement system reviews

  interviews:
  - role: Game Designer
    questions:
    - How do you determine achievement difficulty?
    - What is the intended difficulty progression?
    - How do you cater to different skill levels?
    - What completion rates do you target?
    purpose: Understand difficulty design
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Data Analyst
    questions:
    - What are completion rates by difficulty tier?
    - Where do players struggle or give up?
    - How does completion relate to player skill?
    purpose: Identify difficulty issues from data
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Difficulty specifications
    purpose: Understand intended difficulty
    look_for:
    - Difficulty rating methodology
    - Target completion rates
    - Difficulty progression design
  - type: Completion analytics
    purpose: Assess actual difficulty
    look_for:
    - Completion rates by tier
    - Difficulty walls
    - Skill correlation

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ACDFC-CRIT-001
    signal: Achievement difficulty creates insurmountable walls
    evidence_indicators:
    - Near-zero completion for non-trivial achievements
    - Massive skill jumps between tiers
    - Achievements designed to be unattainable
    - Users give up on achievement progress
    explanation: |
      Insurmountable difficulty walls frustrate users and make
      the achievement system feel pointless.
    remediation: |
      - Add intermediate difficulty steps
      - Ensure all achievements are achievable
      - Create multiple paths to achievement
  high:
  - id: ACDFC-HIGH-001
    signal: Difficulty doesn't scale with skill development
    evidence_indicators:
    - Early achievements too easy
    - Late achievements too hard
    - No smooth difficulty progression
    - Gaps in achievable challenge
    explanation: |
      Mismatched difficulty fails to support player development
      and creates frustration at transition points.
    remediation: |
      - Design smooth difficulty progression
      - Match difficulty to skill development
      - Fill gaps between difficulty tiers
  - id: ACDFC-HIGH-002
    signal: Difficulty relies on grind rather than skill
    evidence_indicators:
    - Hard achievements require time not skill
    - Difficulty through repetition not challenge
    - Skill players can't accelerate completion
    explanation: |
      Grind-based difficulty devalues skill and creates
      tedious engagement rather than satisfying challenge.
    remediation: |
      - Base difficulty on skill challenges
      - Reduce grind requirements
      - Reward skill with faster completion
  medium:
  - id: ACDFC-MED-001
    signal: Difficulty ratings don't match actual difficulty
    evidence_indicators:
    - Easy-rated achievements have low completion
    - Hard-rated achievements completed frequently
    - User perception doesn't match ratings
    remediation: |
      - Recalibrate difficulty ratings
      - Use completion data to inform ratings
      - Set user expectations accurately
  - id: ACDFC-MED-002
    signal: No achievements for casual or mid-skill players
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only trivial or extreme achievements
    - Nothing for average players to pursue
    - Middle difficulty underserved
    remediation: |
      - Add middle-tier achievements
      - Create progression for all skill levels
      - Serve full player skill spectrum
  positive:
  - id: ACDFC-POS-001
    signal: Well-calibrated difficulty progression
    evidence_indicators:
    - Smooth difficulty scaling
    - Achievements for all skill levels
    - Completion rates match intended difficulty
    - Players report appropriate challenge
