  what: |
    Assesses whether achievements are actually completable, including
    time-limited achievements, missable content, and whether all
    players have fair access to achievement completion.
  why_it_matters: |
    Incompletable achievements:
    - Frustrate completionists
    - Create FOMO from missed opportunities
    - Punish players who weren't present at specific times
    - Devalue the achievement system

    Fair completability:
    - All achievements achievable with effort
    - No arbitrary exclusion
    - Reasonable timeframes
    - Equal opportunity for all players
  when_to_run:
  - When designing achievement systems
  - After events with limited-time achievements
  - When reviewing achievement accessibility
  - During completionist experience reviews

  interviews:
  - role: Product Designer
    questions:
    - Are any achievements permanently missable?
    - How do you handle time-limited achievements?
    - What happens to event achievements after events end?
    - Can all players reasonably complete all achievements?
    purpose: Understand completability design
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Community Manager
    questions:
    - What complaints exist about missable achievements?
    - How do players feel about time-limited content?
    - Are there requests for achievement accessibility?
    purpose: Assess community experience
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:

    look_for:
    - Permanently missable achievements
    - Time-limited availability
    - Prerequisites and dependencies

    - Complaints about missed achievements
    - FOMO from limited content
    - Accessibility requests

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ACMPL-CRIT-001
    signal: Permanently missable achievements without return opportunity
    evidence_indicators:
    - One-time events with exclusive achievements
    - No plan to bring back missed content
    - Completionists permanently excluded
    - FOMO design for limited achievements
    explanation: |
      Permanently exclusive achievements punish players for not
      being present at specific times and damage the achievement
      system's value as a completable collection.
    remediation: |
      - Bring back limited-time achievements periodically
      - Offer alternative paths to similar achievements
      - Limit exclusivity to cosmetic variations not achievements
  - id: ACMPL-CRIT-002
    signal: Achievements requiring resources no longer available
    evidence_indicators:
    - Achievements require removed content
    - Prerequisites no longer obtainable
    - Technical issues blocking completion
    - Legacy achievements impossible
    explanation: |
      Achievements that cannot be completed due to removed
      content or technical issues frustrate players.
    remediation: |
      - Remove or replace impossible achievements
      - Restore required content
      - Provide alternative completion paths
  high:
  - id: ACMPL-HIGH-001
    signal: Short time windows creating extreme FOMO
    evidence_indicators:
    - Very short availability windows
    - No advance notice of limited achievements
    - Players miss content through no fault
    - FOMO intentionally exploited
    explanation: |
      Extremely short windows exploit FOMO psychology and punish
      players with other life commitments.
    remediation: |
      - Extend availability windows
      - Provide advance notice
      - Create recurring opportunities
      - Reduce FOMO exploitation
  - id: ACMPL-HIGH-002
    signal: Pay-to-complete achievements
    evidence_indicators:
    - Achievements require purchases
    - Premium content locked achievements
    - Completion requires spending money
    explanation: |
      Achievements gated behind payment create unequal access
      and devalue non-purchasable achievements.
    remediation: |
      - Make all achievements earnable without purchase
      - Separate paid content from achievement requirements
  medium:
  - id: ACMPL-MED-001
    signal: Multiplayer achievements difficult for solo players
    evidence_indicators:
    - Achievements require other players
    - Dead multiplayer makes achievements hard
    - Solo players excluded from completability
    remediation: |
      - Provide solo alternatives
      - Adjust multiplayer requirements over time
      - Consider AI substitutes
  - id: ACMPL-MED-002
    signal: Achievement prerequisites unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - Players don't know how to complete achievements
    - Hidden requirements not documented
    - Frustration from unclear paths
    remediation: |
      - Document achievement requirements clearly
      - Provide progress tracking
      - Show completion paths
  positive:
  - id: ACMPL-POS-001
    signal: All achievements achievable with reasonable effort
    evidence_indicators:
    - No permanently missable achievements
    - Limited-time content returns
    - Clear requirements for all achievements
    - Fair access for all players
