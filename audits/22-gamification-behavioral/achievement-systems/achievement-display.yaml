  what: |
    Assesses how achievements are displayed, celebrated, and
    presented to users and others. Evaluates notification design,
    profile integration, and social visibility controls.
  why_it_matters: |
    Achievement display affects:
    - Satisfaction from recognition
    - Social status and identity
    - Notification fatigue
    - Privacy and visibility preferences
    - Motivation from celebration

    Poor display can create notification spam, unwanted social
    exposure, or insufficient recognition that fails to reinforce
    accomplishment.
  when_to_run:
  - When designing achievement UI
  - After notification fatigue feedback
  - When reviewing user profiles
  - During UX reviews

signals:
  high:
  - id: ACDSP-HIGH-001
    signal: Achievement notifications creating fatigue
    evidence_indicators:
    - Constant achievement popups
    - Users disable notifications entirely
    - Complaints about notification spam
    - Achievements interrupt gameplay
    explanation: |
      Excessive notifications create fatigue and cause users
      to disengage from the achievement system entirely.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce notification frequency
      - Batch minor achievements
      - Allow notification customization
      - Make notifications dismissible
  - id: ACDSP-HIGH-002
    signal: No control over social achievement visibility
    evidence_indicators:
    - Achievements automatically shared
    - No option to hide achievements
    - Private play exposed publicly
    - Users embarrassed by visible achievements
    explanation: |
      Forced achievement visibility violates user privacy and
      autonomy, especially for sensitive or embarrassing content.
    remediation: |
      - Default achievements to private
      - Provide granular visibility controls
      - Allow hiding specific achievements
  medium:
  - id: ACDSP-MED-001
    signal: Achievement celebration doesn't match significance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Major achievements under-celebrated
    - Minor achievements over-celebrated
    - No hierarchy in display
    remediation: |
      - Scale celebration to significance
      - Create memorable major achievement moments
      - Distinguish achievement tiers visually
  - id: ACDSP-MED-002
    signal: Achievement tracking unclear or hidden
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progress hard to find
    - No clear path to completion shown
    - Users don't know what they're close to
    remediation: |
      - Surface achievement progress prominently
      - Show near-completion achievements

    remediation: |
      - Allow showcasing achievements
      - Create achievement-based profile elements
      - Enable achievement-based identity expression
  positive:
  - id: ACDSP-POS-001
