  what: |
    Assesses monetization systems for pay-to-win mechanics where
    real-money purchases provide competitive advantages that cannot
    be reasonably achieved through gameplay alone.
  why_it_matters: |
    Pay-to-win damages:
    - Competitive integrity
    - Player trust and satisfaction
    - Long-term retention
    - Community health
    - Game reputation

    Fair monetization:
    - Sells cosmetics and convenience
    - Respects skill-based competition
    - Allows all players to compete fairly
    - Builds sustainable revenue
  when_to_run:
  - When designing monetization
  - After pay-to-win complaints
  - During competitive balance reviews
  - Before launching premium content

  access_requirements:
  - Monetization designer interviews
  - Competitive balance data
  - Community feedback

  interviews:
  - role: Monetization Designer
    questions:
    - What can be purchased and what does it provide?
    - How do you define pay-to-win vs. acceptable monetization?
    - What competitive advantages can be purchased?
    - Can free players compete with paying players?
    purpose: Understand monetization philosophy
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Game Designer/Balancer
    questions:
    - How do purchases affect competitive balance?
    - What's the maximum advantage from spending?
    - Can skill overcome purchased advantages?
    - How do top performers correlate with spending?
    purpose: Assess competitive impact
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Community Manager
    questions:
    - What do players say about pay-to-win?
    - Are there complaints about monetization fairness?
    - How do free players perceive their competitiveness?
    purpose: Understand player perception
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Purchasable items
    purpose: Catalog competitive impact
    look_for:
    - Power-affecting purchases
    - Time-saving purchases
    - Exclusive content with advantages
  - type: Competitive data
    purpose: Assess actual impact
    look_for:
    - Spending correlation with success
    - F2P vs. paying player performance
    - Meta dominated by paid content

signals:
  critical:
  - id: P2WPRV-CRIT-001
    signal: Direct competitive power purchasable with money
    evidence_indicators:
    - Stronger items/abilities only available for purchase
    - Paid content objectively better than free
    - Skill cannot compensate for purchased advantages
    - Top performers are top spenders
    explanation: |
      When real money directly buys competitive advantage,
      the game becomes pay-to-win by definition.
    remediation: |
      - Make power-affecting items earnable
      - Balance paid items as sidegrades not upgrades
      - Focus monetization on cosmetics/convenience
      - Separate paid and competitive tracks
  - id: P2WPRV-CRIT-002
    signal: Required spending for competitive viability
    evidence_indicators:
    - Free players cannot realistically compete
    - Essential content gated behind payment
    - Meta requires paid items to be viable
    - 'Community consensus: ''must spend to compete'''
    explanation: |
      When spending is required for basic competitiveness,
      the game monetizes access rather than extras.
    remediation: |
      - Ensure F2P competitive viability
      - Make all essential content accessible
      - Design around skill not spending
  high:
  - id: P2WPRV-HIGH-001
    signal: Significant time-to-unlock disparity
    evidence_indicators:
    - Paid unlocks in hours, free in months
    - Unreasonable grind for free acquisition
    - Time-gating designed to frustrate into paying
    explanation: |
      While not direct P2W, extreme time differences effectively
      make content paid-only for most players.
    remediation: |
      - Make free paths reasonable
      - Cap time advantages from payment
      - Ensure free path is enjoyable not punitive
  - id: P2WPRV-HIGH-002
    signal: Purchasable advantages in ranked/competitive modes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Paid advantages allowed in ranked
    - No gear normalization in competitive
    - Rankings reflect spending not skill
    explanation: |
      Competitive modes should measure skill, not spending.
    remediation: |
      - Normalize gear in competitive modes
      - Separate casual (advantages allowed) from ranked
      - Ensure ranked reflects skill
  medium:
  - id: P2WPRV-MED-001
    signal: Pay-for-convenience affecting competitive outcomes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Convenience purchases provide indirect advantages
    - More play time = more success + paid conveniences
    - Convenience items not clearly delineated from power
    remediation: |
      - Clearly separate convenience from power
      - Ensure convenience doesn't affect competitive outcomes
      - Limit cumulative advantage from convenience
  - id: P2WPRV-MED-002
    signal: Loot boxes with competitive items
    evidence_indicators:
    - Competitive items in randomized purchases
    - Gambling mechanics for power items
    - RNG determines competitive capability
    remediation: |
      - Remove competitive items from loot boxes
      - Allow direct purchase of needed items
      - Keep randomization to cosmetics only
  positive:
  - id: P2WPRV-POS-001
    signal: Fair monetization respecting competitive integrity
    evidence_indicators:
    - Monetization limited to cosmetics/convenience
    - Free players can compete at highest levels
    - Spending doesn't predict competitive success
    - Community perceives system as fair
