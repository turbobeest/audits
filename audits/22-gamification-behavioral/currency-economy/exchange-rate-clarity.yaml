  what: |
    Assesses how clearly exchange rates between virtual and real
    currency are communicated, including conversion mathematics,
    display at decision points, and user understanding.
  why_it_matters: |
    Clear exchange rates enable:
    - Informed purchase decisions
    - Fair value assessment
    - Budget planning
    - Trust in the system

    Unclear rates enable:
    - Hidden price increases
    - Confusion-driven overspending
    - Inability to compare value
    - Exploitation through complexity
  when_to_run:
  - When designing currency displays
  - After confusion about value
  - During transparency reviews
  - Before regulatory audits

  access_requirements:
  - Economy designer interviews
  - Currency display implementation
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Economy Designer
    questions:
    - How do you determine exchange rates?
    - How are rates displayed to users?
    - Can users easily calculate real-money costs?
    - Do rates vary or stay constant?
    purpose: Understand exchange rate design
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Exchange rate specifications
    purpose: Understand rate mathematics
    look_for:
    - Base conversion rates
    - Rate variations
    - Display requirements
  - type: User research
    purpose: Assess understanding
    look_for:
    - User confusion about rates
    - Value calculation ability
    - Spending decision factors

  - glob: '**/*reward*.{yaml,json}'
    purpose: Reward configuration
  - glob: '**/*achievement*.{yaml,json}'

signals:
  critical:
  - id: XCHRT-CRIT-001
    signal: Exchange rates deliberately designed to confuse
    evidence_indicators:
    - Odd numbers that don't convert cleanly
    - Different rates for purchasing vs. spending
    - Rates change without notice
    - Design docs cite confusion as strategy
    explanation: |
      Deliberately confusing exchange rates manipulate users
      into poor decisions.
    remediation: |
      - Use clean, simple conversion rates
      - Keep rates consistent
      - Display real-money value at purchase
  high:
  - id: XCHRT-HIGH-001
    signal: Real-money value not shown at point of purchase
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only virtual currency shown in store
    - Users must calculate real cost
    - No option to see real-money prices
    explanation: |
      When users can't see real-money costs, they can't make
      informed spending decisions.
    remediation: |
      - Show real-money equivalent at all purchases
      - Provide toggle for real-money display
      - Make conversion obvious
  - id: XCHRT-HIGH-002
    signal: Multiple exchange rates create confusion
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different rates for different currencies
    - Bonus currency creates effective rate changes
    - Promotions change effective rates
    explanation: |
      Variable rates make value comparison impossible and
      enable hidden price manipulation.
    remediation: |
      - Simplify to single clear rate
      - Show effective rate including bonuses
      - Make promotions transparent
  medium:
  - id: XCHRT-MED-001
    signal: Conversion math requires effort
    evidence_indicators:
    - Non-intuitive conversion numbers
    - Users can't quickly calculate value
    - Requires calculator or lookup
    remediation: |
      - Use round, intuitive numbers
      - Provide conversion helpers
      - Show both currencies simultaneously
  - id: XCHRT-MED-002
    signal: Rate changes not communicated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Rates change without notice
    - Users surprised by effective price changes
    - No changelog for rate adjustments
    remediation: |
      - Announce rate changes in advance
      - Provide rate change history
      - Grandfather existing currency
  positive:
  - id: XCHRT-POS-001
    signal: Clear, consistent exchange rates
    evidence_indicators:
    - Simple, memorable conversion
    - Real-money value shown everywhere
    - Consistent rates without hidden changes
