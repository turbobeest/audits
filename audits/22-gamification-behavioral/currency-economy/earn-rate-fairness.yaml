  what: |
    Assesses the fairness of currency earn rates relative to
    spending costs, evaluating whether players can reasonably
    earn enough currency through gameplay or if rates are designed
    to frustrate players into purchasing.

    Fair earn rates:
    - Respect player time investment

    - Create grind designed to frustrate
    - Make earning feel pointless vs. buying
    - Devalue player time and effort
    - Push players toward spending
  when_to_run:
  - When designing economy earn rates
  - After complaints about grind
  - When comparing earn vs. purchase value
  - During monetization ethics reviews

  critical:
  - id: ERNRT-CRIT-001
    signal: Earn rates designed to be inadequate forcing purchases
    evidence_indicators:
    - Earning takes unreasonable time vs. buying
    - Design docs cite frustration as monetization driver
    - Earn rates make playing feel futile
    - 'Community consensus: earning is pointless'
    explanation: |
      When earn rates are deliberately inadequate to force
      purchases, player time is disrespected and gameplay
      becomes pointless.
    remediation: |
      - Make earning viable and respected
      - Design earn rates for engagement not frustration
      - Value player time appropriately
  high:
  - id: ERNRT-HIGH-001
    signal: Extreme time-to-earn for basic items
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dozens of hours for basic items
    - Essential items take unreasonable grinding
    - Players give up on earning
    - Earning viable only for dedicated players
    explanation: |
      Extreme grind requirements exclude casual players and
      make the economy feel punitive.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce time-to-earn for basic items
      - Ensure casual players can make progress
      - Scale requirements to item significance
  - id: ERNRT-HIGH-002
    signal: Earn rates decline over time
    evidence_indicators:

      false initial impressions.
    remediation: |
      - Maintain consistent earn rates
      - Don't front-load earning
      - Respect long-term player investment
