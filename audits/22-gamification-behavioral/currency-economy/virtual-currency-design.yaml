description:
  what: |
    Assesses virtual currency systems including design, purchasing,
    spending, and value clarity. Evaluates whether currencies are
    designed transparently or to obscure real-money value and exploit
    psychological weaknesses.
  why_it_matters: |
    Virtual currencies can serve legitimate purposes:
    - Simplify transactions
    - Enable earned rewards
    - Create engaging economies

    Or they can exploit:
    - Obscure real-money value of purchases
    - Create purchase bundles that waste money
    - Exploit children and vulnerable users
    - Circumvent spending awareness
  when_to_run:
  - When designing virtual currency systems
  - After regulatory scrutiny
  - When complaints about value arise
  - During monetization ethics reviews

  access_requirements:
  - Economy designer interviews
  - Currency system documentation
  - User spending data
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Economy Designer
    questions:
    - Why use virtual currency vs. direct purchase?
    - How did you determine conversion rates?
    - How do bundle sizes relate to item costs?
    - What protections exist for vulnerable users?
    purpose: Understand currency design philosophy
    duration: 30 min
  - role: User Researcher
    questions:
    - Do users understand virtual currency value?
    - What spending behavior patterns exist?
    - Are there signs of exploitation?
    - How do users feel about currency purchases?
    purpose: Assess user experience
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:

    purpose: Understand design
    look_for:
    - Conversion rates
    - Bundle sizes vs. item costs
    - Multiple currency types
    - Value obfuscation indicators

    - Leftover currency waste
    - Purchase decision patterns

signals:
  critical:
  - id: VRTCR-CRIT-001
    signal: Currency designed to obscure real-money value
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deliberate odd conversion rates
    - Multiple layers of currency
    - No clear real-money equivalent display
    - Design docs cite obfuscation as goal
    explanation: |
      Deliberately obscuring real-money value to increase spending
      is manipulative and may violate consumer protection laws.
    remediation: |
      - Show real-money equivalent at purchase
      - Use clear conversion rates
      - Simplify currency systems
      - Be transparent about value
  - id: VRTCR-CRIT-002
    signal: Bundle sizes designed to create waste
    evidence_indicators:
    - No bundle matches common purchase amounts
    - Always leftover currency
    - Forced to buy more than needed
    - Design exploits unit pricing psychology
    explanation: |
      Deliberate bundle mismatching forces overspending and
      creates pressure to buy more to use remainders.
    remediation: |
      - Offer bundles matching common purchases
      - Allow exact-amount purchases
      - Don't design for currency waste
  - id: VRTCR-CRIT-003
    signal: Targeting minors with virtual currency
    evidence_indicators:
    - Minors can purchase without limits
    - Bright, appealing currency design for children
    - No parental controls
    - Aggressive monetization in child-targeted content
    explanation: |
      Virtual currencies targeting children exploit those who
      cannot understand real-money value.
    remediation: |
      - Implement parental controls
      - Limit minor purchases
      - Require adult verification for purchases
      - Don't target children with monetization
  high:
  - id: VRTCR-HIGH-001
    signal: Multiple confusing currencies
    evidence_indicators:
    - 3+ different currency types
    - Users confused about which currency does what
    - Conversion between currencies unclear
    - Complexity serves obfuscation
    explanation: |
      Multiple complex currencies confuse users and make
      value assessment difficult.
    remediation: |
      - Simplify to fewer currencies
      - Make purpose of each currency clear
      - Show all values in one base currency
  - id: VRTCR-HIGH-002
    signal: No spending controls or limits
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unlimited spending possible
    - No spending warnings or limits
    - No cooldown on purchases
    - One-click large purchases
    explanation: |
      Lack of spending controls enables impulsive overspending
      and exploitation of vulnerable users.
    remediation: |
      - Implement optional spending limits
      - Add confirmation for large purchases
      - Provide spending summaries
      - Enable cooldown periods
  medium:
  - id: VRTCR-MED-001
    signal: Currency purchase UI emphasizes worst value
    evidence_indicators:
    - Best value bundle de-emphasized
    - Middle options pushed toward higher prices
    - Value comparison difficult
    remediation: |
      - Show clear value comparisons
      - Don't manipulate toward higher spending
      - Present options fairly
  - id: VRTCR-MED-002
    signal: Expiring currency creating pressure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Currency expires after period
    - Pressure to spend or lose value
    - Expiration creates waste
    remediation: |
      - Remove currency expiration
      - If expiration needed, provide long windows
      - Warn clearly about expiration
  positive:
  - id: VRTCR-POS-001
    signal: Transparent, user-respecting currency design
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear real-money value shown
    - Bundles match common purchases
    - Single clear currency
    - Spending controls available
