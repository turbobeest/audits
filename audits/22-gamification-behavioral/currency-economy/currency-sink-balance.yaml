description:
  what: |
    Assesses the balance between currency generation (sources) and
    currency removal (sinks) in virtual economies. Evaluates whether
    sinks are attractive and effective while avoiding forced or
    predatory drain mechanics.
  why_it_matters: |
    Balanced sinks provide:
    - Economy stability over time
    - Meaningful spending choices
    - Sustainable currency value
    - Engaging optional purchases

    Unbalanced or forced sinks cause:
    - Currency hoarding (insufficient sinks)
    - Player frustration (aggressive drains)
    - Economic collapse (runaway inflation)
    - Predatory drain mechanics
  when_to_run:
  - When designing virtual economies
  - After currency accumulation issues
  - When economy health degrades
  - During monetization reviews

  interviews:
  - role: Economy Designer
    questions:
    - What mechanisms remove currency from circulation?
    - How do you balance sources and sinks?
    - Are sinks attractive or mandatory?
    - What happens when sinks aren't used?
    purpose: Understand sink design
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Data Analyst
    questions:
    - What is the currency generation vs. removal rate?
    - How is currency accumulating over time?
    - Which sinks are most used?
    - Are there signs of imbalance?
    purpose: Identify balance issues

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CRSNK-CRIT-001
    signal: Forced drain mechanics removing player agency
    evidence_indicators:
    - Mandatory fees or taxes with no alternative
    - Decay mechanics forcing spending
    - Player progress destroyed to create spending
    - No way to avoid currency loss
    explanation: |
      Forced drains that remove player agency are predatory and
      create negative player experience.
    remediation: |
      - Make sinks optional and attractive
      - Don't force spending through mechanics
      - Respect player progress
  high:
  - id: CRSNK-HIGH-001
    signal: Insufficient sinks causing currency accumulation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Players accumulating unused currency
    - Nothing attractive to spend on
    - Currency losing meaning over time
    - Inflation concerns
    explanation: |
      Without attractive sinks, currency accumulates and loses
      value, damaging economy health.
    remediation: |
      - Add attractive optional sinks
      - Create desirable cosmetic or convenience purchases
      - Ensure sinks scale with accumulation
  - id: CRSNK-HIGH-002
    signal: Sinks creating unfair advantage gaps
    evidence_indicators:
    - Power sinks creating have/have-not divide
    - Required spending to remain competitive
    - Sink purchases creating pay-to-win
    explanation: |
      When sinks create power differences, they become
      mandatory rather than optional.
    remediation: |
      - Focus sinks on cosmetics and convenience
      - Don't gate power behind spending
      - Ensure optional nature of sinks
  medium:
  - id: CRSNK-MED-001
    signal: Sink attractiveness varies significantly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some sinks heavily used, others ignored
    - Missing sink categories
    - Uneven value across sinks
    remediation: |
      - Balance sink attractiveness
      - Offer variety for different preferences
      - Ensure good value across options
  - id: CRSNK-MED-002
    signal: Sink value degrades over time
    evidence_indicators:
    - Early sinks lose appeal
    - Players run out of things to buy
    - Long-term players have nothing to spend on
    remediation: |
      - Add ongoing sink content
      - Create repeatable sinks
      - Serve long-term player needs
  positive:
  - id: CRSNK-POS-001
    signal: Healthy source/sink balance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Currency in circulation stable
    - Attractive optional sinks
    - No forced spending mechanics
    - Diverse sink options
