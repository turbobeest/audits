description:
  what: |
    Assesses the use of social proof mechanics including user counts,
    activity indicators, testimonials, and "others are doing this"
    messaging. Evaluates whether social proof is honest and helpful
    or deceptive and manipulative.
  why_it_matters: |
    Social proof is a powerful psychological principle:
    - People look to others' behavior for guidance
    - Can help users make informed decisions
    - Can provide genuine confidence in choices

    When misused:
    - Fake or inflated numbers deceive users
    - Manufactured urgency creates false pressure
    - Misleading testimonials manipulate decisions
    - Privacy violations in activity exposure
  when_to_run:
  - When designing social proof features
  - After concerns about accuracy
  - During ethics reviews of persuasion tactics
  - Before launching user activity displays

    questions:
    - What social proof mechanics are used?
    - Where does the data come from?
    - How accurate are the displayed numbers?
    - What ethical guidelines govern social proof?
    purpose: Understand social proof design and accuracy
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Marketing/Growth Lead
    questions:
    - How is social proof used in conversion?
    - Are there ever approximations or projections?
    - What's the accuracy standard for numbers?
    purpose: Understand business use and accuracy

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SCPRF-CRIT-001
    signal: Deliberately fake or fabricated social proof
    evidence_indicators:
    - Numbers completely fabricated
    - Fake testimonials or reviews
    - Bot-generated activity indicators
    - Manufactured urgency with no basis
    explanation: |
      Fabricating social proof is deception and may violate
      consumer protection laws.
    remediation: |
      - Remove all fake social proof immediately
      - Use only accurate, verifiable data
      - Conduct legal review for compliance
  - id: SCPRF-CRIT-002
    signal: Social proof exposing private user activity
    evidence_indicators:
    - User activity shown without consent
    - Names attached to purchases or actions
    - Private behavior made public
    - No opt-out from activity exposure
    explanation: |
      Exposing user activity without consent violates privacy
      and trust.
    remediation: |
      - Make activity sharing opt-in
      - Anonymize social proof by default
      - Provide granular privacy controls
  high:
  - id: SCPRF-HIGH-001
    signal: Significantly inflated or misleading numbers
    evidence_indicators:
    - Counts include bots or duplicates
    - Time windows cherry-picked for inflation
    - Numbers meaningfully exceed reality
    - Approximations always round up significantly
    explanation: |
      Misleading inflation of social proof deceives users
      and creates false confidence.
    remediation: |
      - Calculate accurate numbers
      - Use fair time windows
      - Round conservatively
      - Clearly label approximations
  - id: SCPRF-HIGH-002
    signal: False urgency through social proof
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''X people viewing now'' is inflated'
    - '''Limited availability'' not actually limited'
    - Urgency messaging loops or repeats
    - Scarcity manufactured not real
    explanation: |
      False urgency manipulates users into hasty decisions
      they may regret.
    remediation: |
      - Only show accurate real-time data
      - Make scarcity claims truthful
      - Don't manufacture urgency
  medium:
  - id: SCPRF-MED-001
    signal: Social proof lacks context for interpretation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Numbers shown without timeframe
    - Activity counts without explanation
    - Users can't evaluate meaning of numbers
    remediation: |
      - Provide context for all numbers
      - Explain what counts represent
      - Help users interpret social proof
  - id: SCPRF-MED-002
    signal: Testimonials lack authenticity verification
    evidence_indicators:
    - No verification testimonials are real
    - Could be fake or incentivized
    - No disclosure of incentives
    remediation: |
      - Verify testimonial authenticity
      - Disclose any incentives
      - Use verified user feedback
  low:
  - id: SCPRF-LOW-001
    signal: Social proof accuracy not validated
    evidence_indicators:
    - No audit of social proof accuracy
    - Accuracy assumed not verified
    remediation: |
      - Validate social proof accuracy
      - Implement accuracy monitoring
  positive:
  - id: SCPRF-POS-001
    signal: Honest, helpful social proof
    evidence_indicators:
    - All numbers accurately calculated
    - Context provided for interpretation
    - No manufactured urgency
    - User privacy respected
