  what: |
    Assesses the balance of competitive mechanics including matchmaking,
    ranking systems, competitive events, and PvP features. Evaluates
    whether competition is fair, accessible, and maintains healthy
    engagement across skill levels.
  why_it_matters: |
    Balanced competition provides:
    - Fair matches that feel winnable
    - Skill development through appropriate challenge
    - Engagement across skill levels
    - Healthy competitive motivation

    Unbalanced competition causes:
    - Frustration from unfair matches
    - Stomping of new or casual players
    - Quitting from hopeless matchups
    - Toxicity from competitive frustration
  when_to_run:
  - When designing competitive features
  - After matchmaking complaints
  - When engagement varies by skill level
  - During competitive system reviews

    questions:
    - What is the win rate distribution across players?
    - How do match outcomes relate to skill ratings?
    - Where are the biggest balance issues?
    - How does engagement vary by competitive success?
    purpose: Identify balance issues from data

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CMPBL-CRIT-001
    signal: Pay-to-win advantages dominating competition
    evidence_indicators:
    - Purchased power determines competitive outcomes
    - Skill cannot overcome spending advantages
    - Top competitors are top spenders
    - Community consensus on pay-to-win
    explanation: |
      Competition dominated by spending rather than skill is
      fundamentally unfair and drives away skilled players.
    remediation: |
      - Remove purchased competitive advantages
      - Separate paid and skilled competition
      - Balance purchased items as sidegrades
  - id: CMPBL-CRIT-002
    signal: New players destroyed by veterans
    evidence_indicators:
    - New players matched against veterans
    - New player quit rate extremely high
    - No protected learning environment
    - Skill floor too high for entry
    explanation: |
      When new players have no chance, they leave immediately,
      and the competitive community stagnates.
    remediation: |
      - Implement new player protection periods
      - Create skill-appropriate matchmaking
      - Provide learning environments
  high:
  - id: CMPBL-HIGH-001
    signal: Matchmaking creating consistently unfair matches
    evidence_indicators:
    - Large skill disparities in matches
    - Predictable outcomes before match starts
    - Players frequently stomped or stomping
    - Match quality metrics poor
    explanation: |
      Consistently unfair matches frustrate both winners
      (no challenge) and losers (no chance).
    remediation: |
      - Improve skill rating accuracy
      - Tighten matchmaking skill bands
      - Prioritize match quality over speed
  - id: CMPBL-HIGH-002
    signal: Competitive toxicity from frustration
    evidence_indicators:
    - High toxicity in competitive modes
    - Blaming teammates for systemic issues
    - Griefing and throwing matches
    - Competitive modes avoided for toxicity
    explanation: |
      When competition creates frustration rather than engagement,
      toxicity emerges and harms the community.
    remediation: |
      - Address root causes of frustration
      - Implement anti-toxicity measures
      - Improve competitive experience quality
  medium:
  - id: CMPBL-MED-001
    signal: Competitive modes inaccessible to casual players
    evidence_indicators:
    - Casual players avoid competition
    - Entry barrier too high
    - No casual competitive options
    remediation: |
      - Create casual competitive modes
      - Lower entry barriers
      - Provide skill-appropriate challenges
  - id: CMPBL-MED-002
    signal: Ranking system creates anxiety
    evidence_indicators:
    - Players afraid to compete to protect rank
    - Ranked anxiety common
    - Players avoid ranked despite interest
    remediation: |
      - Reduce ranking volatility
      - Create low-stakes competitive options
      - Focus on improvement not rank
  positive:
  - id: CMPBL-POS-001
    signal: Fair, engaging competition across skill levels
    evidence_indicators:
    - Balanced matches across skill tiers
    - Engagement consistent across ranks
    - Players feel competition is fair
    - New players can learn and improve
