  what: |
    Assesses leaderboard design and implementation, evaluating
    whether competitive rankings support healthy motivation or
    create harmful social comparison, demotivation, and anxiety.
    Examines inclusivity, segmentation, and psychological safety.
  why_it_matters: |
    Leaderboards trigger powerful social comparison psychology:

    Positive outcomes when designed well:
    - Healthy competition driving engagement
    - Aspirational motivation from visible success
    - Community building through shared goals
    - Recognition for achievement

    Harmful outcomes when designed poorly:
    - Demotivation from unfavorable comparison
    - Anxiety from public performance exposure
    - Exclusion of non-competitive users
    - Mental health impacts from constant ranking
    - Reinforcement of existing inequities
  when_to_run:
  - When designing leaderboard systems
  - After user feedback about competitive stress
  - When engagement patterns suggest demotivation
  - During mental health and wellbeing reviews
  - Before launching public ranking features

signals:
  critical:
  - id: LDBRD-CRIT-001
    signal: Mandatory leaderboards causing documented psychological harm
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users report anxiety or depression from rankings
    - No opt-out available for competitive features
    - Mental health concerns raised by users
    - Vulnerable populations (minors, mental health) exposed
    explanation: |
      Mandatory exposure to competitive ranking can cause
      real psychological harm, especially for vulnerable users.
    remediation: |
      - Implement opt-out for leaderboard participation
      - Allow hiding from public rankings
      - Provide alternative non-competitive engagement
      - Add safeguards for vulnerable populations
  - id: LDBRD-CRIT-002
    signal: Leaderboards amplifying existing inequities
    evidence_indicators:
    - Pay-to-win advantages dominate rankings
    - New users cannot realistically compete
    - Demographics correlated with ranking success
    - Leaderboard positions effectively purchasable
    explanation: |
      When leaderboards primarily reflect spending or privilege
      rather than skill/effort, they amplify unfairness and
      demoralize disadvantaged participants.
    remediation: |
      - Separate leaderboards by spending level
      - Create skill-based ranking segregated from power
      - Implement new user protected competitions
      - Remove purchased advantages from rankings
  high:
  - id: LDBRD-HIGH-001
    signal: Bottom-ranking users experience demotivation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Low-ranking users show decreased engagement
    - Negative feedback about being at bottom
    - Users leave after seeing unfavorable ranking
    - Only top performers find leaderboards motivating
    explanation: |
      Leaderboards that demotivate the majority while only
      benefiting top performers create net negative impact.
    remediation: |
      - Show relative progress, not just ranking
      - Create tiered leaderboards for fair competition
      - Focus on personal improvement over rank
      - Implement local/friend leaderboards
  - id: LDBRD-HIGH-002
    signal: Competitive toxicity emerging from leaderboard design
    evidence_indicators:
    - Harassment of high-ranking users
    - Cheating to maintain leaderboard positions
    - Hostile community around competition
    - Users sabotaging others' rankings
    explanation: |
      When leaderboards create toxic competition, they harm
      community health and individual experience.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce stakes of leaderboard positions
      - Implement anti-toxicity measures
      - Consider cooperative alternatives
      - De-emphasize leaderboard visibility
  medium:
  - id: LDBRD-MED-001
    signal: Leaderboard not segmented for fair comparison
    evidence_indicators:
    - Beginners compete against veterans
    - Casual users in same rankings as hardcore
    - Time zone or schedule affects competition
    remediation: |
      - Implement skill-based tiering
      - Create separate casual and competitive tracks
      - Segment by comparable cohorts
  - id: LDBRD-MED-002
    signal: No privacy controls for ranking visibility
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users cannot hide their ranking
    - Performance publicly visible by default
    - No choice about competitive exposure
    remediation: |
      - Allow users to hide ranking
      - Make competitive participation opt-in
      - Provide granular visibility controls
  low:
  - id: LDBRD-LOW-001
    signal: Leaderboard psychological impact not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No research on competitive stress
    - Only engagement metrics tracked
    - Demotivation not measured
    remediation: |
      - Research psychological experience
      - Track motivation across ranking levels
      - Measure wellbeing alongside engagement
  positive:
  - id: LDBRD-POS-001
    signal: Healthy competition with psychological safeguards
