  what: |
    Assesses collaborative and cooperative mechanics including team
    goals, group challenges, social quests, and referral systems.
    Evaluates whether collaboration incentives support genuine
    community building or create social pressure and obligation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Collaborative mechanics can create:
    - Genuine community and connection
    - Shared accomplishment and bonding
    - Mutual support and encouragement
    - Positive social motivation

    Or they can cause:
    - Social pressure and obligation
    - Guilt for not participating
    - Harassment of non-contributors
    - Exploitation of social relationships
  when_to_run:
  - When designing collaborative features
  - After user feedback about social pressure
  - When evaluating community health
  - During ethics reviews of social mechanics
prerequisites:

    description: Documentation of cooperative features
  - type: user_feedback
    description: Data on user experience with collaboration
  access_requirements:
  - Product designer interviews
  - Community feedback access
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Product Designer
    questions:
    - What collaborative features exist?
    - How do you prevent social pressure?
    - What happens when team members don't contribute?
    - Can users participate solo without penalty?
    purpose: Understand collaboration design
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Community Manager
    questions:
    - What social pressure issues have emerged?
    - How do teams handle non-contributors?
    - Is there harassment around collaboration?
    - Do users feel obligated rather than wanting to participate?
    purpose: Assess social dynamics
    duration: 30 min

    look_for:
    - Team requirements and penalties
    - Individual vs. group rewards
    - Consequences for non-participation
  - type: Community feedback
    purpose: Assess experience

    - Social pressure complaints
    - Obligation vs. enjoyment
    - Team conflict reports

signals:
  critical:
  - id: COLNC-CRIT-001
    signal: Collaboration mechanics enabling harassment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users pressured or harassed for not contributing
    - Team mechanics create conflict and toxicity
    - Non-contributors punished socially
    - Design enables identifying and targeting individuals
    explanation: |
      Collaboration systems that enable or encourage harassment
      create hostile environments and harm users.
    remediation: |
      - Remove individual contribution visibility
      - Eliminate mechanics that create pressure
      - Implement anti-harassment measures
      - Allow solo alternatives to team content
  - id: COLNC-CRIT-002
    signal: Mandatory collaboration blocking solo players
    evidence_indicators:
    - Core content requires team participation
    - No solo alternative for collaborative content
    - Users forced to interact socially
    - Solo players effectively excluded
    explanation: |
      Forcing social participation excludes users who prefer
      or require solo play and disrespects user autonomy.
    remediation: |
      - Provide solo alternatives for all content
      - Make collaboration optional not required
      - Allow flexible participation levels
  high:
  - id: COLNC-HIGH-001
    signal: Social obligation overriding enjoyment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users participate from guilt not desire
    - Team commitments feel like work
    - Users resent collaborative requirements
    - Engagement from obligation not interest
    explanation: |
      When collaboration becomes obligation, it damages
      enjoyment and creates negative associations.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce commitment requirements
      - Make participation flexible
      - Focus on enjoyment over obligation
  - id: COLNC-HIGH-002
    signal: Referral incentives exploiting relationships
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users pressure friends for referral rewards
    - Social relationships monetized
    - Referral spam damaging relationships
    - Friends feel used
    explanation: |
      Referral systems that incentivize exploiting personal
      relationships damage trust and social bonds.
    remediation: |
      - Limit referral pressure mechanics
      - Focus on value to invitee not inviter
      - Cap referral rewards
  medium:
  - id: COLNC-MED-001
    signal: Unequal contribution creating resentment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some users carry teams
    - Unequal contribution visibility
    - Resentment toward low contributors
    remediation: |
      - Reduce visibility of individual contribution
      - Design for flexible participation
      - Focus on team success not individual effort
  - id: COLNC-MED-002
    signal: Team failures punishing individuals
    evidence_indicators:
    - Individuals penalized for team failure
    - Others' non-participation affects user rewards
    - Frustration from uncontrollable outcomes
    remediation: |
      - Separate individual from team consequences
      - Don't penalize for others' behavior
      - Provide alternatives when teams fail
  positive:
  - id: COLNC-POS-001
    signal: Collaboration that builds genuine community
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users enjoy collaborative content
    - Friendships form through cooperation
    - Solo alternatives available
    - Participation is joyful not obligatory
