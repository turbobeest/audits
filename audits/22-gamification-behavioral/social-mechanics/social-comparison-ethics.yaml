description:
  what: |
    Assesses all social comparison mechanisms where users see their
    performance, status, or progress relative to others. Evaluates
    ethical implications of comparison features including mental
    health impacts, demographic biases, and manipulation potential.
  why_it_matters: |
    Social comparison is deeply rooted in human psychology:
    - Upward comparison can inspire but also demoralize
    - Downward comparison can reassure but also breed contempt
    - Constant comparison affects self-esteem and wellbeing
    - Vulnerable users disproportionately impacted

    Ethical design requires understanding these dynamics and
    implementing safeguards against harm while preserving benefits.
  when_to_run:
  - When designing social features
  - After mental health concerns raised
  - When evaluating community health
  - During ethics reviews of social mechanics

  interviews:
  - role: Product Designer
    questions:
    - What social comparison features exist?
    - How do you consider psychological impact?
    - What safeguards exist against harmful comparison?
    - Can users control comparison visibility?
    purpose: Understand design approach to social comparison
    duration: 30 min
  - role: User Researcher
    questions:
    - How do users experience social comparison features?
    - Is there evidence of negative psychological impact?
    - Which users are most vulnerable to comparison harm?
    - What feedback exists on social pressure?
    purpose: Assess psychological impact
    duration: 30 min

    - Where users see others' performance
    - How comparisons are presented
    - User controls available
  - type: User wellbeing research
    purpose: Assess psychological impact
    look_for:
    - Self-esteem impacts
    - Anxiety from comparison
    - Vulnerable user experiences

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SOCMP-CRIT-001
    signal: Social comparison causing documented psychological harm
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users report depression, anxiety from comparisons
    - Mental health decline correlated with usage
    - Vulnerable populations significantly impacted
    - No safeguards or opt-out available
    explanation: |
      Social comparison features causing measurable psychological
      harm require immediate intervention.
    remediation: |
      - Implement opt-out from all comparison features
      - Add wellbeing safeguards
      - Reduce comparison prominence
      - Provide mental health resources
  - id: SOCMP-CRIT-002
    signal: Comparison features designed to exploit insecurity
    evidence_indicators:
    - Design emphasizes others' success vs. user's lack
    - Notifications highlight unfavorable comparisons
    - Monetization tied to reducing comparison anxiety
    - Design docs cite insecurity as engagement driver
    explanation: |
      Deliberately exploiting psychological vulnerabilities
      through comparison is manipulative and harmful.
    remediation: |
      - Redesign for positive motivation
      - Remove exploitative comparison emphasis
      - Focus on personal progress over comparison
  high:
  - id: SOCMP-HIGH-001
    signal: Mandatory comparison with no user control
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users cannot opt out of seeing comparisons
    - Others' performance forced into user experience
    - No privacy controls for own performance
    explanation: |
      Forced social comparison without user control disrespects
      user autonomy and psychological safety.
    remediation: |
      - Make comparison features optional
      - Provide granular visibility controls
      - Allow hiding own performance from others
  - id: SOCMP-HIGH-002
    signal: Unfair comparisons creating learned helplessness
    evidence_indicators:
    - New users compared to veterans
    - Comparisons ignore contextual differences
    - Users feel they can never measure up
    - Disengagement from persistent unfavorable comparison
    explanation: |
      Unfair comparisons can create learned helplessness where
      users give up because they cannot compete.
    remediation: |
      - Compare only comparable cohorts
      - Account for context in comparisons
      - Focus on personal trajectory over absolute ranking
  medium:
  - id: SOCMP-MED-001
    signal: Comparison emphasizes negative over positive
    evidence_indicators:
    - Notifications about falling behind
    - More visibility to others' success than own
    - Comparison framed as competition not community
    remediation: |
      - Reframe comparison positively
      - Emphasize shared goals and community
      - Balance others' success with own progress
  - id: SOCMP-MED-002
    signal: Comparison lacks context for fair interpretation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Raw numbers shown without explanation
    - No information about how others achieved results
    - Comparison ignores effort, time, resources
    remediation: |
      - Provide context for comparisons
      - Show effort and time alongside results
      - Help users understand what comparison means
  low:
  - id: SOCMP-LOW-001
    signal: Social comparison impact not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No research on psychological effects
    - Only engagement metrics tracked
    remediation: |
      - Research user psychological experience
      - Track wellbeing alongside engagement
  positive:
  - id: SOCMP-POS-001
    signal: Ethical comparison with psychological safeguards
    evidence_indicators:
    - Full user control over comparison visibility
    - Fair, contextualized comparisons
    - Focus on inspiration not competition
    - Mental health considered in design
