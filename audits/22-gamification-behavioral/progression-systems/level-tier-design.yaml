  what: |
    Assesses level and tier progression systems that structure user
    advancement through discrete stages. Evaluates whether the design
    creates meaningful accomplishment, supports intrinsic motivation,
    and avoids artificial inflation or manipulative gating.
  why_it_matters: |
    Level systems transform abstract engagement into concrete progress,
    providing powerful motivation when designed well:

    Positive outcomes:
    - Clear progression paths increase engagement
    - Sense of accomplishment at each milestone
    - Skill mastery through graduated challenge
    - User retention through visible investment

    Negative outcomes:
    - Inflated levels feel meaningless
    - Arbitrary gates frustrate users
    - Progress divorced from real value
    - Addictive design patterns without benefit
  when_to_run:
  - When designing progression systems
  - When user feedback suggests progression feels hollow
  - After observing low milestone satisfaction
  - During ethical review of gamification mechanics
  - Before launching new tier/level features

  - tool: Progression Curve Analysis
    purpose: Evaluate XP requirements across levels
    description: |
      Plot XP requirements against level number. Analyze curve
      shape: linear, exponential, S-curve. Assess whether curve
      matches user skill development and available content.
  - tool: Level Value Assessment
    purpose: Evaluate meaning of level achievements
    description: |
      For each level or tier: document rewards, unlocks, and
      status changes. Rate the perceived value vs. effort required.
      Identify empty levels with no meaningful reward.
  - tool: Inflation Detector
    purpose: Identify meaningless level proliferation
    description: |
      Compare user perception of levels to actual benefits.
      Identify signs of inflation: too many levels, trivial
      early levels, indistinguishable mid-levels.
signals:
  critical:
  - id: LVLTR-CRIT-001
    signal: Levels designed primarily for time-on-platform rather than value
    evidence_indicators:
    - Many levels with no meaningful difference
    - Progression disconnected from skill or content
    - Design docs cite engagement time as primary goal
    - Users report levels feel meaningless
    explanation: |
      When levels exist primarily to extend engagement time without
      providing meaningful progression or value, they become
      manipulative rather than motivating.
    remediation: |
      - Consolidate meaningless levels
      - Ensure each level provides distinct value
      - Tie progression to real skill development
      - Make levels about accomplishment, not time spent
  - id: LVLTR-CRIT-002
    signal: Arbitrary level gates blocking core functionality
    evidence_indicators:
    - Essential features locked behind high levels
    - No skill-based reason for gates
    - Gates designed to frustrate into payment
    - Users describe gates as punitive
    explanation: |
      Level gates that exist to frustrate users into paying or
      grinding rather than to support learning or progression
      are exploitative design patterns.
    remediation: |
      - Unlock core features early
      - Gate advanced features, not basic ones
      - Ensure gates have learning rationale
      - Provide meaningful progression to unlock
  high:
  - id: LVLTR-HIGH-001
    signal: Severe progression curve creating grind wall
    evidence_indicators:
    - Exponential curve with no content to match
    - Large user drop-off at specific levels
    - Time-to-level becomes unreasonable
    - User complaints about grind
    explanation: |
      When progression curves outpace available content or
      reasonable time investment, users face grind walls that
      feel punitive rather than challenging.
    remediation: |
      - Flatten progression curve
      - Add content to justify time investment
      - Create alternate progression paths
      - Implement catch-up mechanics
  - id: LVLTR-HIGH-002
    signal: Level inflation diminishing accomplishment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dozens of levels with trivial differences
    - Early levels gained too quickly to feel meaningful
    - User perception of levels as meaningless
    - High levels don't indicate expertise
    explanation: |
      Inflated level systems reduce the sense of accomplishment,
      making progression feel hollow rather than rewarding.
    remediation: |
      - Consolidate levels to meaningful milestones
      - Slow down early progression to create value
      - Make each level feel like an achievement
      - Tie levels to real competency
  medium:
  - id: LVLTR-MED-001
    signal: Level rewards don't match progression effort
    evidence_indicators:
    - Late levels require much more effort for same rewards
    - Milestone levels lack special recognition
    - Users feel unrewarded for continued investment
    remediation: |
      - Scale rewards with effort required
      - Create memorable milestone celebrations
      - Ensure late-game progression feels worthwhile
  - id: LVLTR-MED-002
    signal: Unclear connection between levels and capabilities
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users don't understand what levels represent
    - No clear mapping of levels to skills/content
    - Levels feel arbitrary
    remediation: |
      - Clearly communicate level meaning
      - Map levels to concrete capabilities
      - Show progression path transparently
  low:
  - id: LVLTR-LOW-001
    signal: Level experience not measured for satisfaction
    evidence_indicators:
    - No user research on level satisfaction
    - Only progression metrics tracked
    - Accomplishment sentiment not measured
    remediation: |
      - Research user experience of leveling
      - Track satisfaction alongside progression
      - Iterate based on accomplishment feedback
  positive:
  - id: LVLTR-POS-001
    signal: Meaningful progression with clear accomplishment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Each level represents real progress
    - Users feel accomplished at milestones
    - Progression matches skill development
    - Rewards scale appropriately with effort
  - id: LVLTR-POS-002
    signal: Balanced progression curve with good pacing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Smooth progression without walls
    - Content available at each level
    - Time investment feels appropriate
    - Users stay engaged through levels
