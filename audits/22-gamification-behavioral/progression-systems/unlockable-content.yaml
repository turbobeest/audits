  what: |
    Assesses content unlocking systems where features, items, or
    experiences are gated behind progression requirements. Evaluates
    whether gating serves user benefit (scaffolding, earned reward)
    or creates artificial frustration to drive engagement or monetization.
  why_it_matters: |
    Content unlocking can serve legitimate purposes:
    - Scaffolding complex features for new users
    - Creating sense of accomplishment and earning
    - Pacing content delivery appropriately
    - Rewarding investment and mastery

    Or it can be harmful:
    - Gating basic features to frustrate users into paying
    - Artificial barriers with no learning rationale
    - Forcing grind for content already paid for
    - Creating unfair advantages for paying users
  when_to_run:
  - When designing content gating systems
  - After user complaints about locked content
  - When conversion pressure exists on unlocking
  - During fairness and accessibility reviews

    - What content is locked and why?
    - How do you decide what requires unlocking?
    - What's the rationale for each gate?
    - How do you balance unlocking with accessibility?
    - Are there paid bypasses for locked content?
    purpose: Understand gating philosophy and rationale
    duration: 30 min
  - role: User Researcher
    questions:
    - How do users experience content gating?
    - Which gates feel fair vs. frustrating?
    - Do users understand why content is locked?
    - What feedback exists on unlock requirements?
    purpose: Assess user perception of gating
    duration: 30 min

signals:
  critical:
  - id: UNLCK-CRIT-001
    signal: Core functionality gated to force payment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Basic features locked behind premium
    - Essential content requires excessive grind or payment
    - No reasonable free path to unlock
    - Users feel extorted
    explanation: |
      Gating core functionality to extract payment rather than
      for scaffolding or reward is exploitative and damages trust.
    remediation: |
      - Unlock core features early or free
      - Reserve gating for advanced/optional content
      - Ensure reasonable free unlock paths
      - Gate for learning, not monetization
  - id: UNLCK-CRIT-002
    signal: Gating advertised content users paid for
    evidence_indicators:
    - Paid content requires additional grind to access
    - DLC or purchased content behind progression walls
    - Advertising promises content users can't access
    explanation: |
      Requiring additional effort to access paid content is
      deceptive and potentially violates consumer protection.
    remediation: |
      - Make purchased content immediately accessible
      - Don't gate paid content behind progression
      - Be honest in advertising about unlock requirements
  high:
  - id: UNLCK-HIGH-001
    signal: Unlock requirements disproportionate to content value
    evidence_indicators:
    - Minor content requires extensive unlocking
    - Unlock effort exceeds content value
    - Users don't bother unlocking available content
    explanation: |
      When unlock effort vastly exceeds content value, the
      system feels punitive rather than rewarding.
    remediation: |
      - Scale requirements to content value
      - Make valuable content worth earning
      - Reduce barriers to minor content
  - id: UNLCK-HIGH-002
    signal: Gating without scaffolding rationale
    evidence_indicators:
    - Content locked for no learning reason
    - Users ready for content but artificially blocked
    - Gates exist purely for engagement extension
    explanation: |
      Gating should serve users by scaffolding complexity, not
      artificially extend engagement without benefit.
    remediation: |
      - Unlock content when users are ready
      - Gate for learning, not time extension
      - Remove gates with no scaffolding purpose
  medium:
  - id: UNLCK-MED-001
    signal: Unclear unlock requirements
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users don't know how to unlock content
    - Requirements not clearly communicated
    - Unexpected gates create frustration
    remediation: |
      - Clearly show unlock requirements
      - Communicate progress toward unlocks
      - Set clear expectations upfront
  - id: UNLCK-MED-002
    signal: Inconsistent unlocking logic
    evidence_indicators:
    - Similar content has different requirements
    - Unlock logic feels arbitrary
    - Users confused about gating patterns
    remediation: |
      - Standardize unlock logic
      - Create consistent patterns
      - Explain rationale to users
  low:
  - id: UNLCK-LOW-001
    signal: User satisfaction with unlocking not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No research on gating experience
    - Only completion metrics tracked
    remediation: |
      - Research user experience with gates
      - Track satisfaction alongside completion
  positive:
  - id: UNLCK-POS-001
    signal: Gating serves learning and scaffolding
    evidence_indicators:
    - Gates help users build skills progressively
    - Unlocking feels like earned reward
    - Users appreciate pacing and scaffolding
  - id: UNLCK-POS-002
    signal: Fair unlock paths for all users
    evidence_indicators:
    - All content unlockable through play
    - Paid options are time-savers not essentials
    - Requirements feel proportionate
