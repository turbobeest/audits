description:
  what: |
    Assesses the pacing of progression systems - the rate at which
    users advance, encounter new content, and experience rewards.
    Evaluates whether pacing supports engagement and satisfaction
    or creates artificial grind walls and manipulative slowdowns.
  why_it_matters: |
    Good pacing creates:
    - Consistent sense of progress and achievement
    - Appropriate challenge escalation
    - Content matching progression rate
    - Satisfaction throughout the experience

    Poor pacing causes:
    - Grind walls that frustrate and exhaust
    - Artificial slowdowns to extend engagement
    - Early rushing followed by stagnation
    - Content gaps where progression outruns material
  when_to_run:
  - When designing progression timing
  - After user complaints about grind
  - When engagement drops mid-experience
  - During economy and progression reviews

  interviews:

    questions:
    - What pacing targets do you aim for?
    - How do you balance content with progression rate?
    - Where do you expect players to spend the most time?
    - How do you prevent grind walls?
    - What intentional slowdowns exist and why?
    purpose: Understand pacing philosophy
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Data Analyst
    questions:
    - Where are the progression bottlenecks?
    - How does session length change through progression?
    - Where do users drop off or take breaks?
    - What is the time-to-level at each stage?
    purpose: Identify pacing issues from data
    duration: 30 min

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PACNG-CRIT-001
    signal: Artificial grind walls designed to force payment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Sharp progression slowdown at purchase prompts
    - Grind dramatically reduced by payment
    - Design docs cite monetization at slowdowns
    - Players identify pay-to-skip walls
    explanation: |
      Creating artificial frustration to extract payment is
      manipulative and damages user experience.
    remediation: |
      - Remove grind walls aligned with monetization
      - Make progression satisfying without payment
      - Monetize convenience, not basic progress
  - id: PACNG-CRIT-002
    signal: Pacing designed for time-on-platform over satisfaction
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progression artificially extended without content
    - Engagement time prioritized over enjoyment
    - Users describe experience as tedious
    - High churn from pacing frustration
    explanation: |
      Extending engagement time without providing value
      wastes user time and erodes satisfaction.
    remediation: |
      - Align progression with content availability
      - Prioritize satisfaction over time metrics
      - Add content or reduce progression requirements
  high:
  - id: PACNG-HIGH-001
    signal: Severe grind walls creating user exhaustion
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dramatic increase in time-to-level
    - Users describe exhaustion or burnout
    - High drop-off at specific points
    - Repetitive content requirements
    explanation: |
      Grind walls exhaust users and often cause permanent
      disengagement, harming long-term retention.
    remediation: |
      - Flatten progression curve
      - Add variety to requirements
      - Create multiple progression paths
  - id: PACNG-HIGH-002
    signal: Content gaps where progression outruns material
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users advance faster than content releases
    - Endgame has nothing meaningful to do
    - Users wait for content with nothing to progress
    explanation: |
      When progression outpaces content, users hit walls
      with nothing meaningful to engage with.
    remediation: |
      - Balance progression rate with content creation
      - Create engaging endgame systems
      - Use horizontal progression when vertical exhausted
  medium:
  - id: PACNG-MED-001
    signal: Inconsistent pacing creating jarring transitions
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progression speed varies dramatically
    - Unexpected slowdowns surprise users
    - Pacing doesn't match content difficulty
    remediation: |
      - Smooth out pacing transitions
      - Communicate expected pacing changes
      - Align pacing with content intensity
  - id: PACNG-MED-002
    signal: Early pacing too fast, setting false expectations
    evidence_indicators:
    - Rapid early progression
    - Users disappointed when pace normalizes
    - Early levels don't prepare for later pace
    remediation: |
      - Set appropriate expectations early
      - Avoid misleading initial pacing
      - Transition gradually to sustainable pace
  low:
  - id: PACNG-LOW-001
    signal: Pacing satisfaction not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No research on pacing experience
    - Only progression metrics tracked
    remediation: |
      - Research user satisfaction with pacing
      - Track satisfaction alongside progression
  positive:
  - id: PACNG-POS-001
    signal: Satisfying pacing with consistent progress
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users feel consistent progress
    - Content matches progression rate
    - No significant grind complaints
    - Engagement maintained through experience
  - id: PACNG-POS-002
    signal: Pacing respects user time
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progression feels earned not extracted
    - Users describe time as well spent
    - No artificial extension identified
