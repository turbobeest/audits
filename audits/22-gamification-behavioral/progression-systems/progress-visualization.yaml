  what: |
    Assesses progress visualization elements including progress bars,
    completion percentages, trackers, and advancement indicators.
    Evaluates whether visualizations accurately represent progress,
    leverage goal gradient psychology ethically, and support user
    motivation without manipulation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Progress visualization leverages powerful psychological effects:

    Goal Gradient Effect:
    - Motivation intensifies as users approach completion
    - Visual progress triggers dopamine release
    - People work harder to complete what they've started

    Risks of manipulation:
    - False progress creates distrust when reality doesn't match
    - Inflated completion percentages mislead users
    - Endless progress bars demotivate over time
    - Manipulative chunking hides true effort required
  when_to_run:
  - When designing progress visualization elements
  - After user feedback about misleading progress
  - When completion rates don't match expectations
  - During UX ethics reviews
  - Before launching onboarding or tutorial flows

tooling:
  assessment_tools:
  - tool: Progress Accuracy Audit
    purpose: Compare visual progress to actual progress
    description: |
      For each progress visualization: document displayed
      percentage, actual completion percentage, calculation
      method. Flag discrepancies >10%.
  - tool: Endowed Progress Assessment
    purpose: Evaluate artificial starting progress
    description: |
      Identify instances of endowed progress. Assess whether
      starting progress is disclosed, reasonable, and not
      deceptive.
  - tool: Progress Chunking Review
    purpose: Evaluate task breakdown in progress
    description: |
      Assess whether task chunking accurately represents
      effort or hides complexity. Check if early steps are
      artificially easy to inflate initial progress.
signals:
  critical:
  - id: PRGVS-CRIT-001
    signal: Progress visualization deliberately misrepresents actual progress
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progress percentage significantly exceeds actual completion
    - Steps weighted to show fast early progress, slow later progress
    - Design docs cite engagement as reason for inflation
    - Users report feeling deceived by progress
    explanation: |
      Deliberately misleading progress visualization exploits goal
      gradient psychology deceptively, eroding trust when users
      discover the reality doesn't match.
    remediation: |
      - Recalculate progress to reflect actual completion
      - Weight steps by actual effort/time required
      - Prioritize accuracy over initial engagement
      - Be transparent about progress methodology
  - id: PRGVS-CRIT-002
    signal: Endless progress bars that never reach completion
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progress bars that reset or extend indefinitely
    - Completion targets that move as user approaches
    - Progress that loops without clear end state
    - Users describe progress as meaningless
    explanation: |
      Progress visualization that never allows completion
      exploits completion drive without delivering satisfaction,
      creating frustration and distrust.
    remediation: |
      - Define clear, achievable completion states
      - Don't move goalposts after user invests effort
      - Celebrate genuine completion
      - Be honest about ongoing vs. completable progress
  high:
  - id: PRGVS-HIGH-001
    signal: Undisclosed endowed progress creating false accomplishment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progress starts at non-zero without explanation
    - Users think they've accomplished more than reality
    - Artificial head start not disclosed
    explanation: |
      Endowed progress can be ethical when disclosed, but
      hidden artificial progress deceives users about their
      actual accomplishment.
    remediation: |
      - Disclose endowed progress clearly
      - Consider whether endowed progress is necessary
      - Ensure users understand their true starting point
  - id: PRGVS-HIGH-002
    signal: Progress visualization hides true effort required
    evidence_indicators:
    - Early steps trivially easy, later steps difficult
    - Significant effort required after 90% shown
    - Users surprised by work remaining near 'completion'
    explanation: |
      When progress chunking hides the true effort distribution,
      users feel misled when the last 10% takes as long as the
      first 90%.
    remediation: |
      - Weight progress by actual effort required
      - Be honest about effort distribution
      - Consider showing both steps and effort progress
  medium:
  - id: PRGVS-MED-001
    signal: Progress visualization lacks meaningful milestones
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progress bar moves smoothly without landmarks
    - No celebration of intermediate achievements
    - Users can't gauge where they are in journey
    remediation: |
      - Add meaningful milestone markers
      - Celebrate intermediate achievements
      - Help users understand their position in the journey
  - id: PRGVS-MED-002
    signal: Progress calculation inconsistent or confusing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different screens show different progress
    - Progress jumps unexpectedly
    - Users confused about what counts toward progress
    remediation: |
      - Standardize progress calculation
      - Ensure consistency across touchpoints
      - Communicate what contributes to progress
  low:
  - id: PRGVS-LOW-001
    signal: Progress visualization lacks user testing
    evidence_indicators:
    - No research on progress perception accuracy
    - Design based on assumptions not validation
    remediation: |
      - Test progress perception with users
      - Validate accuracy of mental models
  positive:
  - id: PRGVS-POS-001
    signal: Accurate and honest progress visualization
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progress accurately reflects completion
    - Effort distribution honestly represented
    - Users report progress matches expectations
  - id: PRGVS-POS-002
    signal: Effective use of goal gradient psychology
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progress visualization motivates without manipulating
    - Clear milestones provide intermediate satisfaction
    - Completion feels achievable and rewarding
