  what: |
    Assesses milestone design including placement, spacing, rewards,
    and celebration. Evaluates whether milestones create meaningful
    accomplishment markers, sustain motivation through long journeys,
    and avoid manipulation or artificial inflation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Well-designed milestones serve critical psychological functions:
    - Break overwhelming goals into achievable chunks
    - Provide regular dopamine hits through the journey
    - Create natural reflection and celebration points
    - Help users measure progress and adjust effort

    Poorly designed milestones can:
    - Feel arbitrary or meaningless
    - Be spaced too far apart (demotivating) or too close (trivial)
    - Celebrate insignificant achievements
    - Fail to sustain motivation through long experiences
  when_to_run:
  - When designing progression milestone systems
  - After user feedback about lacking accomplishment
  - When engagement drops during mid-journey
  - During gamification design reviews

    title: A Game Design Workshop
    type: book
    reference: Tracy Fullerton, CRC Press
    relevance: Game progression and milestone design
signals:
  critical:
  - id: MLSTN-CRIT-001
    signal: Milestones designed to obscure lack of real progress
    evidence_indicators:
    - Frequent milestones masking no actual advancement
    - Celebrations for trivial non-achievements
    - Milestones substitute for missing content
    - Users describe milestones as hollow
    explanation: |
      When milestones exist to create illusion of progress without
      substance, they become manipulative rather than motivating.
    remediation: |
      - Tie milestones to genuine accomplishments
      - Ensure substance matches celebration
      - Be honest about what milestones represent
  high:
  - id: MLSTN-HIGH-001
    signal: Milestone spacing creates motivation desert
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long gaps between milestones mid-journey
    - User drop-off in milestone-sparse areas
    - Complaints about lack of recognition
    explanation: |
      When milestones are too far apart, users lose motivation
      during the journey and may abandon before reaching the next marker.
    remediation: |
      - Add intermediate milestones in sparse areas
      - Create mini-celebrations between major milestones
      - Ensure consistent motivation throughout journey
  - id: MLSTN-HIGH-002
    signal: Early milestones trivial, late milestones unattainable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Many easy early milestones, few late ones
    - Users feel diminished accomplishment over time
    - Late milestones require unreasonable effort
    explanation: |
      Imbalanced milestone distribution front-loads satisfaction
      and fails to sustain motivation through the full experience.
    remediation: |
      - Balance milestone distribution across journey
      - Ensure late milestones remain achievable
      - Scale celebration to match actual difficulty
  medium:
  - id: MLSTN-MED-001
    signal: Milestone rewards don't match significance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Major milestones have minor rewards
    - Inconsistent reward scaling
    - Users underwhelmed by milestone rewards
    remediation: |
      - Scale rewards to milestone significance
      - Ensure major achievements feel major
      - Provide memorable celebration for key moments
  - id: MLSTN-MED-002
    signal: Milestones lack meaningful differentiation
    evidence_indicators:
    - All milestones feel the same
    - No variety in celebration or reward type
    - Users become numb to milestones
    remediation: |
      - Vary milestone types and celebrations
      - Create memorable unique milestones
      - Prevent milestone fatigue through diversity
  low:
  - id: MLSTN-LOW-001
    signal: Milestone impact not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No data on milestone effectiveness
    - User satisfaction with milestones unknown
    remediation: |
      - Track engagement around milestones
      - Research user perception of milestones
  positive:
  - id: MLSTN-POS-001
    signal: Meaningful, well-spaced milestones
    evidence_indicators:
    - Milestones mark genuine accomplishments
    - Consistent motivation through journey
    - Users report milestones as meaningful
    - Balanced distribution across experience
