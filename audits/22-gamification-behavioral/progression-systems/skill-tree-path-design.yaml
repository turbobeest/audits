  what: |
    Assesses skill tree and progression path designs where users
    make choices about how to develop their character, skills, or
    capabilities. Evaluates whether choices are meaningful, options
    are balanced, and the design supports player agency.
  why_it_matters: |
    Well-designed skill trees provide:
    - Meaningful choices that shape unique playstyles
    - Balanced options making multiple builds viable
    - Player agency and self-expression
    - Replayability through different paths
    - Clear feedback on choice consequences

    Poor skill tree design causes:
    - Illusion of choice with obvious optimal paths
    - Trap choices that disadvantage players
    - Overwhelming complexity without guidance
    - Forced respec purchases to fix mistakes
    - Pay-to-win through premium skill options
  when_to_run:
  - When designing skill or specialization systems
  - After user feedback about lack of viable options
  - When meta becomes stale or dominated by one build
  - During balance reviews

    questions:
    - What is the design philosophy for skill choices?
    - How do you ensure multiple viable builds?
    - How do you handle trap choices or imbalance?
    - What feedback do players have on choice meaningfulness?
    - Can players correct mistakes without payment?
    purpose: Understand design intent and balance approach
    duration: 45 min
  - role: Data Analyst
    questions:
    - What is the distribution of skill choices?
    - Are there dominant or unused options?
    - How does choice correlate with success?
    - What patterns exist in respec behavior?
    purpose: Identify balance issues from data
    duration: 30 min

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SKPTH-CRIT-001
    signal: Premium-only skills creating pay-to-win advantage
    evidence_indicators:
    - Powerful skills locked behind premium
    - Paid options objectively superior
    - Free players cannot compete with premium builds
    - Community identifies pay-to-win
    explanation: |
      Gating competitive power behind payment is exploitative
      and undermines skill-based competition.
    remediation: |
      - Make premium options cosmetic or convenience
      - Ensure all powerful builds achievable for free
      - Balance premium options as sidegrades
  - id: SKPTH-CRIT-002
    signal: Trap choices designed to drive respec purchases
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clearly inferior options not marked
    - Easy to make regrettable choices
    - Respecs require real money
    - Design docs cite respec revenue
    explanation: |
      Creating traps that require payment to escape is
      predatory design that punishes learning.
    remediation: |
      - Remove or rebalance trap options
      - Warn users about consequential choices
      - Provide free or low-cost respec options
  high:
  - id: SKPTH-HIGH-001
    signal: Dominant meta with no viable alternatives
    evidence_indicators:
    - One build significantly outperforms others
    - High-end content requires specific build
    - Community consensus on 'best' build
    - Other options feel punishing
    explanation: |
      When one path dominates, choice becomes illusion and
      player expression is eliminated.
    remediation: |
      - Rebalance dominant options"
      - Buff underperforming paths
      - Create content where different builds excel
  - id: SKPTH-HIGH-002
    signal: Overwhelming complexity without guidance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Hundreds of choices with no direction
    - New players paralyzed by options
    - High regret rate from early choices
    - Requires external guides to understand
    explanation: |
      Complexity without support creates anxiety and
      punishes new players who make uninformed choices.
    remediation: |
      - Provide recommended builds for beginners
      - Surface information about choice impacts
      - Allow trial periods before commitment
      - Offer guidance without removing agency
  medium:
  - id: SKPTH-MED-001
    signal: Early choices lack sufficient information
    evidence_indicators:
    - Consequences of early choices unclear
    - Users don't understand until much later
    - Regret common for early decisions
    remediation: |
      - Provide clear information about consequences
      - Allow low-impact early exploration
      - Delay consequential choices until informed
  - id: SKPTH-MED-002
    signal: Respec options insufficient or too costly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users stuck with regretted builds
    - Respec too expensive for casual players
    - Meta shifts punish committed builds
    remediation: |
      - Provide reasonable respec options
      - Consider free respecs after balance changes
      - Allow partial adjustments not full rebuilds
  low:
  - id: SKPTH-LOW-001
    signal: Build viability not monitored
    evidence_indicators:
    - No tracking of build usage and success
    - Balance changes not data-informed
    remediation: |
      - Implement build tracking analytics
      - Monitor viability across options
  positive:
  - id: SKPTH-POS-001
    signal: Multiple viable builds with meaningful tradeoffs
    evidence_indicators:
    - Diverse builds succeed in content
    - Choices represent genuine tradeoffs
    - Player expression through builds
    - Meta includes multiple options
  - id: SKPTH-POS-002
    signal: Accessible complexity with player agency
    evidence_indicators:
    - Guidance available without forced paths
    - Reasonable respec options
    - New players can learn without punishment
