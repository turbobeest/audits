description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the reward schedule patterns implemented in gamified systems,
    including fixed ratio, variable ratio, fixed interval, and variable
    interval reinforcement schedules. Assesses whether reward mechanisms
    are designed ethically or exploit psychological vulnerabilities
    similar to gambling mechanics.
  why_it_matters: |
    Variable ratio schedules are the most psychologically compelling
    reinforcement pattern - the same mechanism that makes slot machines
    addictive. When used irresponsibly, these schedules can:
    - Create compulsive usage patterns resembling addiction
    - Exploit vulnerable users (minors, those prone to addiction)
    - Prioritize engagement metrics over user welfare
    - Erode trust when users feel manipulated
    - Create regulatory and legal liability
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching gamified features
  - During UX ethics reviews
  - When implementing loot boxes or random rewards
  - After complaints about addictive mechanics
  - During regulatory compliance assessments

tooling:
  assessment_tools:
  - tool: Octalysis Scoring Tool
    purpose: Evaluate white-hat vs black-hat motivation balance
    description: |
      Apply the Octalysis framework to score reward systems on each
      core drive. Systems heavily weighted toward Black Hat drives
      (Scarcity, Unpredictability, Avoidance) require additional scrutiny.
  - tool: Reward Schedule Matrix
    purpose: Map all rewards to reinforcement schedule type
    description: |
      Create matrix with columns: Reward, Schedule Type, Frequency,
      Value Variance, Transparency, Safeguards. Flag variable ratio
      schedules without disclosed probabilities.
  - tool: User Engagement Heatmap
    purpose: Identify compulsive usage patterns
    description: |
      Analyze session frequency, duration, and time-of-day patterns
      to identify segments with potentially unhealthy engagement.
signals:
  critical:
  - id: RWDSCH-CRIT-001
    signal: Undisclosed variable ratio rewards targeting vulnerable populations
    evidence_indicators:
    - Randomized rewards with hidden probabilities
    - No pity system or mercy rule for random rewards
    - System accessible to minors without safeguards
    - No spending limits or time warnings
    explanation: |
      Variable ratio schedules with hidden odds mirror gambling mechanics.
      When targeting or accessible to vulnerable users without safeguards,
      this creates significant ethical and legal liability.
    remediation: |
      - Disclose all reward probabilities clearly
      - Implement pity systems guaranteeing rewards after N attempts
      - Add age verification and parental controls
      - Implement spending and time limits with user control
  - id: RWDSCH-CRIT-002
    signal: Reward mechanics designed to induce compulsive behavior
    evidence_indicators:
    - Near-miss mechanics showing 'almost won' outcomes
    - Escalating reward teases to encourage continued play
    - Loss aversion triggers ('play now or lose progress')
    - Analytics explicitly tracking 'addiction' metrics
    explanation: |
      Deliberate use of psychological manipulation techniques to induce
      compulsive behavior is unethical and increasingly subject to
      regulatory action.
    remediation: |
      - Remove near-miss mechanics from reward displays
      - Eliminate loss aversion pressure tactics
      - Reframe metrics around user satisfaction, not compulsion
      - Conduct ethical review of all engagement mechanics
  high:
  - id: RWDSCH-HIGH-001
    signal: Variable ratio schedules without transparency or safeguards
    evidence_indicators:
    - Random rewards exist but odds are not disclosed
    - No documentation of intended drop rates
    - No pity system exists
    - Users report feeling manipulated
    explanation: |
      Even when not deliberately exploitative, hidden variable ratio
      schedules can create problematic engagement patterns and erode
      user trust.
    remediation: |
      - Document and publish all reward probabilities
      - Implement pity systems for rare rewards
      - Add transparency UI showing odds before engagement
      - Monitor for unhealthy engagement patterns
  - id: RWDSCH-HIGH-002
    signal: Reward timing designed to maximize re-engagement over user welfare
    evidence_indicators:
    - Rewards timed to interrupt sleep patterns (midnight resets)
    - Short expiration windows creating urgency
    - Re-engagement notifications at psychologically optimal times
    - Design docs prioritize DAU/retention over user satisfaction
    explanation: |
      When reward timing prioritizes business metrics over user welfare,
      the system may cause real harm to users' lives and wellbeing.
    remediation: |
      - Allow user-configurable reward timing
      - Extend or remove artificial expiration windows
      - Respect user notification preferences
      - Add user welfare metrics to success criteria
  medium:
  - id: RWDSCH-MED-001
    signal: Over-reliance on variable rewards without balanced fixed rewards
    evidence_indicators:
    - Majority of valuable rewards are randomized
    - Predictable effort is not reliably rewarded
    - Users cannot plan or work toward specific rewards
    remediation: |
      - Balance randomized rewards with predictable progression paths
      - Ensure core value can be achieved without gambling mechanics
      - Provide 'earn directly' alternatives to random acquisition
  - id: RWDSCH-MED-002
    signal: Reward inflation reducing perceived value over time
    evidence_indicators:
    - Early rewards are generous, later rewards stingy
    - Users report diminishing satisfaction with rewards
    - Economy requires increasing effort for same value
    remediation: |
      - Design sustainable reward curves
      - Avoid front-loading rewards for initial engagement
      - Maintain consistent effort-to-reward ratios
  low:
  - id: RWDSCH-LOW-001
    signal: Reward schedule documentation is incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reward systems exist without formal documentation
    - Probabilities are implemented but not specified in design docs
    remediation: |
      - Document all reward schedules with intended behavior
      - Include psychological rationale in design documentation
  positive:
  - id: RWDSCH-POS-001
    signal: Transparent reward systems with user-respecting design
    evidence_indicators:
    - All probabilities clearly disclosed to users
    - Pity systems guarantee rewards after reasonable attempts
    - Users can earn all rewards through predictable effort
    - Time and spending controls available to users
  - id: RWDSCH-POS-002
    signal: White-hat motivation emphasis in reward design
    evidence_indicators:
    - Rewards tied to mastery, accomplishment, and creativity
    - Users report feeling satisfied rather than compelled
    - Design docs show ethical consideration in decisions
