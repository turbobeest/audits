  what: |
    Assesses the implementation of unexpected reward patterns including
    surprise bonuses, random gifts, and serendipitous discoveries.
    Evaluates whether these mechanisms enhance user experience through
    genuine delight or exploit dopamine responses for engagement.
  why_it_matters: |
    Unexpected rewards can be powerful forces for either good or harm:

    Positive uses:
    - Create memorable, delightful moments
    - Reward exploration and curiosity
    - Generate authentic positive emotion

    Harmful uses:
    - Exploit dopamine pathways similar to gambling
    - Create compulsive checking behaviors
    - Manipulate users into addiction-like patterns

    The line between motivation and manipulation lies in intent,
    frequency, and whether the design respects user autonomy.
  when_to_run:
  - When designing surprise reward mechanics
  - After observing compulsive checking behaviors
  - During ethical review of engagement mechanics
  - When user feedback suggests manipulation concerns
  - Before launching random reward features

tooling:
  assessment_tools:
  - tool: Surprise Reward Inventory
    purpose: Catalog all unexpected reward mechanisms
    description: |
      Document each surprise mechanic with: trigger, frequency,
      value, user segment, and design goal. Flag high-frequency
      or high-value surprises for closer scrutiny.
  - tool: Compulsion Pattern Detector
    purpose: Identify addiction-like behavioral patterns
    description: |
      Analyze check frequency, session timing, and time-between-
      sessions to identify users exhibiting compulsive patterns
      around surprise reward opportunities.
  - tool: Intent vs. Impact Matrix
    purpose: Compare design intent with actual behavior impact
    description: |
      Map each surprise mechanism: stated goal, behavioral impact,
      user perception. Flag misalignments where impact differs
      significantly from stated positive intent.
signals:
  critical:
  - id: UNRWD-CRIT-001
    signal: Surprise rewards designed to create compulsive checking
    evidence_indicators:
    - Design docs cite 'engagement' through uncertainty
    - Notification system emphasizes checking for rewards
    - Analytics show compulsive check patterns
    - User reports of feeling unable to stop checking
    explanation: |
      When surprise mechanics are designed to exploit dopamine
      responses for engagement metrics rather than genuine delight,
      they cross into manipulative territory similar to gambling.
    remediation: |
      - Redesign surprises to reward genuine engagement
      - Remove notifications that create checking pressure
      - Implement meaningful cooling-off periods
      - Shift focus from engagement to satisfaction metrics
  - id: UNRWD-CRIT-002
    signal: Variable reward exploitation of vulnerable populations
    evidence_indicators:
    - No age verification for dopamine-exploiting features
    - High-intensity surprise mechanics accessible to minors
    - No safeguards for addiction-prone users
    - Targeting algorithms optimize for susceptibility
    explanation: |
      Variable rewards have outsized impact on vulnerable users
      including minors and those prone to addiction. Lack of
      safeguards creates significant ethical and legal risk.
    remediation: |
      - Implement age-appropriate design
      - Add voluntary intensity controls
      - Create opt-out mechanisms for sensitive users
      - Remove susceptibility-based targeting
  high:
  - id: UNRWD-HIGH-001
    signal: High-frequency surprises creating expectation rather than delight
    evidence_indicators:
    - Surprises so frequent they become expected
    - Users complain when 'surprise' doesn't happen
    - Delight converted to entitlement
    - Absence of surprise causes negative emotion
    explanation: |
      When surprises become predictable, they lose their positive
      power and instead create negative responses when absent,
      inverting the intended emotional effect.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce frequency to maintain genuine surprise"
      - Vary timing and type to prevent prediction
      - Focus on quality of delight over quantity
      - Allow surprises to be truly unexpected
  - id: UNRWD-HIGH-002
    signal: FOMO messaging around surprise opportunities
    evidence_indicators:
    - Notifications about 'missing' potential surprises
    - Time pressure around surprise availability
    - Social comparison about others' surprises
    - Loss framing rather than gain framing
    explanation: |
      Using fear of missing out around surprise rewards converts
      a potentially positive mechanic into anxiety-driven
      manipulation.
    remediation: |
      - Remove FOMO messaging entirely
      - Frame surprises positively when received, not negatively when missed
      - Eliminate artificial time pressure
      - Don't show others' surprises to create jealousy
  medium:
  - id: UNRWD-MED-001
    signal: Surprise rewards disproportionate to value delivered
    evidence_indicators:
    - High dopamine impact for low actual value
    - Presentation inflates perceived significance
    - Users disappointed after initial excitement
    remediation: |
      - Calibrate surprise intensity to actual value
      - Ensure lasting satisfaction, not just initial spike
      - Focus on genuinely valuable surprises
  - id: UNRWD-MED-002
    signal: Unclear boundary between expected and surprise rewards
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users confused about what is guaranteed vs. surprise
    - Surprise mechanics feel like slot machines
    - Expectation management unclear
    remediation: |
      - Clearly distinguish guaranteed from surprise rewards
      - Make base value clear; surprises are bonuses
      - Communicate mechanics transparently
  low:
  - id: UNRWD-LOW-001
    signal: Surprise reward impact not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No satisfaction metrics for surprises
    - Only engagement metrics tracked
    - User perception not assessed
    remediation: |
      - Add satisfaction and delight metrics
      - Balance engagement with wellbeing measures
      - Conduct qualitative research on experience
  positive:
  - id: UNRWD-POS-001
    signal: Genuine delight-focused surprise design
    evidence_indicators:
    - Surprises reward authentic engagement
    - Users describe positive emotions without compulsion
    - Low frequency maintains genuine unexpectedness
    - No FOMO or pressure mechanics
  - id: UNRWD-POS-002
    signal: Ethical safeguards for vulnerable users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Age-appropriate surprise intensity
    - Opt-out available for sensitive users
    - Monitoring for concerning patterns
    - Intervention for at-risk users
