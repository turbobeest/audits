  what: |
    Assesses the long-term sustainability of reward economies, examining
    currency generation rates, sink mechanisms, and value preservation
    over time. Identifies inflationary pressures that devalue player
    effort and erode engagement.
  why_it_matters: |
    Uncontrolled reward inflation creates cascading problems:
    - Past achievements lose meaning as rewards become common
    - Currency loses purchasing power, frustrating long-term players
    - Players abandon official currency for alternative trading
    - New content must be increasingly powerful, creating power creep
    - Trust erodes when investment appears devalued
    - Games with balanced economies show up to 45% better retention
  when_to_run:
  - When designing game economy systems
  - When adding new currency sources
  - After observing currency accumulation patterns
  - When players report rewards feeling less valuable
  - Before major economy updates

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RWDINF-CRIT-001
    signal: Hyperinflation rendering currency meaningless
    evidence_indicators:
    - Currency accumulation vastly exceeds sinks
    - Players use alternative items as currency
    - Official currency prices increased 10x+ to compensate
    - Community describes currency as 'worthless'
    explanation: |
      When official currency becomes so devalued that players
      abandon it, the entire economy and progression system
      loses meaning, severely damaging engagement.
    remediation: |
      - Implement emergency currency sinks
      - Consider controlled reset mechanisms
      - Add valuable sink targets to draw out currency
      - Reduce or cap currency generation rates
  - id: RWDINF-CRIT-002
    signal: Deliberate devaluation of past player investment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Previously rare rewards made common
    - Paid content devalued without compensation
    - Early supporters' status symbols lost meaning
    - Design docs show intentional obsolescence
    explanation: |
      Deliberately devaluing past investment betrays player
      trust and punishes loyal players, damaging long-term
      retention and community health.
    remediation: |
      - Preserve value of early/paid investments
      - Provide legacy status for original owners
      - Avoid releasing identical items at lower costs
      - Communicate respectfully about economy changes
  high:
  - id: RWDINF-HIGH-001
    signal: Currency generation significantly exceeds sinks
    evidence_indicators:
    - Currency in circulation growing >10% monthly
    - Players accumulating faster than spending
    - Sink mechanisms underutilized
    - Economy requires constant new sink content
    explanation: |
      Structural imbalance between generation and sinks creates
      accumulating inflation pressure requiring constant
      intervention to manage.
    remediation: |
      - Add attractive currency sinks
      - Reduce generation rates
      - Implement diminishing returns on farming
      - Consider seasonal reset mechanisms
  - id: RWDINF-HIGH-002
    signal: Power creep devaluing existing rewards
    evidence_indicators:
    - New rewards strictly better than old rewards
    - Old content becomes trivially easy
    - Players must constantly upgrade to remain viable
    - Previous achievements meaningless
    explanation: |
      When new content must be more powerful to remain attractive,
      previous player investment loses meaning and engagement
      becomes a treadmill rather than progression.
    remediation: |
      - Design sidegrades rather than upgrades
      - Maintain relevance of existing content
      - Use horizontal progression alternatives
      - Limit power range between content tiers
  medium:
  - id: RWDINF-MED-001
    signal: Moderate inflation eroding purchasing power
    evidence_indicators:
    - Prices rising faster than earning rates
    - Time to earn rewards increasing
    - Player complaints about grind increasing
    remediation: |
      - Adjust generation/sink balance"
      - Maintain consistent effort-to-reward ratios
      - Monitor and respond to inflation metrics
  - id: RWDINF-MED-002
    signal: Uneven inflation impacting different player segments
    evidence_indicators:
    - Veterans accumulate while new players struggle
    - Paying players immune to inflation effects
    - Casual players disproportionately affected
    remediation: |
      - Implement segment-specific balancing
      - Add catch-up mechanisms for affected segments
      - Ensure inflation impacts all players equitably
  low:
  - id: RWDINF-LOW-001
    signal: Inflation monitoring not established
    evidence_indicators:
    - No metrics tracking currency in circulation
    - No defined inflation targets
    - Economy changes made without data
    remediation: |
      - Implement economy health dashboards
      - Define acceptable inflation parameters
      - Establish regular economy review cadence
  positive:
  - id: RWDINF-POS-001
    signal: Sustainable economy with balanced flow
    evidence_indicators:
    - Currency in circulation stable over time
    - Sinks and sources in equilibrium
    - Past investments maintain value
    - No power creep in new content
  - id: RWDINF-POS-002
    signal: Proactive inflation management
    evidence_indicators:
    - Economy metrics actively monitored
    - Inflation targets defined and met
    - Interventions made before crisis
    - Player trust in economy stability
