  what: |
    Assesses the equity of reward distribution across user populations.
    Examines whether reward systems provide fair opportunities for all
    users regardless of time availability, financial resources, skill
    level, or demographic factors. Evaluates distributive justice in
    gamified environments.
  why_it_matters: |
    Unfair reward systems create significant harms:
    - Pay-to-win mechanics exclude users without financial resources
    - Time-gated rewards disadvantage working adults and caregivers
    - Skill-biased systems demotivate beginners and casual users
    - Geographic or demographic bias creates discriminatory outcomes
    - Perceived unfairness erodes trust and community health
    - Regulatory scrutiny increasing for exploitative monetization
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching monetized reward systems
  - After user complaints about fairness
  - When significant user segment engagement diverges
  - During accessibility and inclusion reviews
  - Before entering regulated markets

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RWDFR-CRIT-001
    signal: Pay-to-win mechanics creating insurmountable advantages
    evidence_indicators:
    - Competitive success correlates strongly with spending
    - Skill cannot compensate for purchased advantages
    - Top performers are predominantly heavy spenders
    - Community widely perceives system as pay-to-win
    explanation: |
      When real money purchases create advantages that skill and
      time cannot overcome, the system is fundamentally unfair and
      exploitative, extracting payment for competitive viability.
    remediation: |
      - Convert power advantages to cosmetic/convenience purchases
      - Implement skill-based matchmaking independent of gear
      - Cap competitive advantage from purchases
      - Create F2P-viable competitive paths
  - id: RWDFR-CRIT-002
    signal: Systematic exclusion of user segments from meaningful rewards
    evidence_indicators:
    - Valuable rewards have no free acquisition path
    - Time requirements exclude working adults/caregivers
    - Geographic restrictions block entire populations
    - Accessibility barriers prevent disabled users from earning
    explanation: |
      Excluding user segments from meaningful participation violates
      principles of equitable design and may constitute discrimination.
    remediation: |
      - Ensure free paths to all meaningful rewards
      - Provide flexible timing for time-gated content
      - Remove unjustified geographic restrictions
      - Implement accessibility options for all reward paths
  high:
  - id: RWDFR-HIGH-001
    signal: Significant advantage gap between paying and free users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Paying users earn rewards 5x+ faster
    - Premium content is meaningfully better
    - Free path to rewards is unreasonably long
    - User complaints about 'whales' dominating
    explanation: |
      Large gaps between paying and free users create a two-tier
      system that frustrates free users and extracts payment through
      disadvantage rather than value.
    remediation: |
      - Balance premium purchases toward convenience, not power
      - Ensure free users can remain competitive with more time
      - Cap the rate advantage from spending
      - Make premium content sidegrade not upgrade
  - id: RWDFR-HIGH-002
    signal: New user disadvantage without catch-up mechanisms
    evidence_indicators:
    - Veterans have insurmountable advantages over new users
    - No mechanisms help new users reach competitive viability
    - New user churn significantly higher than established users
    - Community perceived as unwelcoming to newcomers
    explanation: |
      Systems that permanently disadvantage new users create
      barriers to entry and community stagnation.
    remediation: |
      - Implement catch-up mechanics for new users
      - Create protected spaces for learning
      - Scale rewards to help newer users progress faster
      - Match new users appropriately
  medium:
  - id: RWDFR-MED-001
    signal: Time-gated rewards disadvantage certain user segments
    evidence_indicators:
    - Daily login rewards punish vacation/absence
    - Event timing excludes certain time zones
    - Real-time requirements conflict with work schedules
    remediation: |
      - Allow flexible timing for daily rewards
      - Offer multiple time windows for events
      - Implement catch-up or makeup mechanics
  - id: RWDFR-MED-002
    signal: Skill-only rewards demotivate casual users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Meaningful rewards require high skill thresholds
    - No participation rewards for effort
    - Casual users report feeling excluded
    remediation: |
      - Offer tiered rewards for different skill levels
      - Recognize effort, not just success
      - Create separate tracks for competitive vs. casual play
  low:
  - id: RWDFR-LOW-001
    signal: Fairness perception differs from actual fairness
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users perceive unfairness despite equitable design
    - Communication about fairness is unclear
    remediation: |
      - Improve transparency about reward distribution
      - Communicate fairness measures proactively
  positive:
  - id: RWDFR-POS-001
    signal: Equitable reward distribution across user segments
    evidence_indicators:
    - All meaningful rewards accessible to all users
    - Monetization is cosmetic or convenience only
    - Diverse user segments achieve comparable success
    - Community perceives system as fair
  - id: RWDFR-POS-002
    signal: Active fairness measures and catch-up mechanics
    evidence_indicators:
    - Mechanisms help disadvantaged users catch up
    - Flexible timing accommodates diverse lifestyles
    - Multiple paths to rewards for different play styles
