  what: |
    Examines how reward systems frame, present, and communicate value
    to users. Assesses whether perceived value accurately reflects
    actual value, how hedonic adaptation is managed, and whether
    framing techniques manipulate rather than inform users.
  why_it_matters: |
    Users make engagement decisions based on perceived reward value.
    When perception is artificially inflated through manipulative
    framing, users may:
    - Invest more time/money than the actual value justifies
    - Feel deceived when reality doesn't match perception
    - Experience accelerated hedonic adaptation leading to dissatisfaction
    - Develop distorted expectations affecting real-world decisions
    - Lose trust in the platform when manipulation becomes apparent
  when_to_run:
  - When designing reward presentation systems
  - After user complaints about reward value
  - When engagement declines despite maintained rewards
  - During monetization ethics reviews
  - Before launching premium reward tiers

tooling:
  assessment_tools:
  - tool: Value Perception Gap Analysis
    purpose: Quantify difference between presented and actual value
    description: |
      For each reward type, document:
      1. Actual value (cost to provide, utility delivered)
      2. Presented value (visual emphasis, language, comparisons)
      3. User perceived value (from research/surveys)
      Calculate perception gap and manipulation indicators.
  - tool: Framing Technique Inventory
    purpose: Catalog all value-framing techniques in use
    description: |
      Identify techniques: artificial scarcity, anchor pricing,
      social proof, urgency messaging, visual inflation,
      complexity obfuscation. Rate each for manipulation risk.
  - tool: Hedonic Adaptation Tracker
    purpose: Assess how value perception changes over time
    description: |
      Map user engagement/satisfaction curves against reward
      cadence to identify adaptation patterns and manipulation
      through novelty exploitation.
signals:
  critical:
  - id: RVPRC-CRIT-001
    signal: Systematic deception in reward value presentation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Fake 'original prices' or 'discounts' for rewards
    - Misleading comparisons to real-world value
    - False scarcity claims (countdown timers that reset)
    - Intentional complexity to obscure true value
    explanation: |
      Deliberately deceiving users about reward value is unethical
      and potentially illegal under consumer protection laws.
    remediation: |
      - Remove all deceptive value framing immediately
      - Conduct legal review for compliance issues
      - Implement transparent value communication policy
      - Train team on ethical presentation standards
  - id: RVPRC-CRIT-002
    signal: Value framing designed to exploit cognitive biases
    evidence_indicators:
    - Anchoring to unrealistic reference points
    - Exploiting loss aversion with artificial deadlines
    - Complexity designed to prevent value calculation
    - Design docs cite manipulation as explicit strategy
    explanation: |
      While cognitive biases exist, deliberately exploiting them
      to extract more engagement or money than informed users
      would provide is manipulative.
    remediation: |
      - Redesign value presentation for clarity
      - Remove artificial urgency mechanics
      - Provide clear, comparable value information
      - Establish ethical design guidelines
  high:
  - id: RVPRC-HIGH-001
    signal: Significant gap between perceived and actual value
    evidence_indicators:
    - User research shows >50% overestimation of value
    - Presentation emphasizes attributes rewards don't have
    - Visual design inflates importance beyond utility
    - Users express disappointment after acquisition
    explanation: |
      Large perception gaps lead to user disappointment, eroded
      trust, and eventual disengagement when reality clarifies.
    remediation: |
      - Calibrate presentation to match actual value
      - Conduct perception testing with neutral framing
      - Adjust visual emphasis to match utility
      - Provide clear value expectations before commitment
  - id: RVPRC-HIGH-002
    signal: Exploitative hedonic adaptation management
    evidence_indicators:
    - Rewards deliberately devalued to drive new purchases
    - Planned obsolescence of reward value
    - Constant escalation required to maintain satisfaction
    - Design strategy relies on treadmill effect
    explanation: |
      Deliberately accelerating hedonic adaptation to drive
      continued spending creates a manipulative cycle that
      harms user welfare.
    remediation: |
      - Design for sustainable value delivery
      - Introduce novelty without devaluing existing rewards
      - Focus on intrinsic value, not artificial scarcity
      - Enable user control over engagement pace
  medium:
  - id: RVPRC-MED-001
    signal: Overemphasis on presentation vs. substance
    evidence_indicators:
    - More resources on presentation than reward quality
    - User satisfaction doesn't match engagement metrics
    - Diminishing returns on reward excitement
    remediation: |
      - Balance presentation investment with value delivery
      - Track satisfaction metrics alongside engagement
      - Invest in actual reward quality improvements
  - id: RVPRC-MED-002
    signal: Inconsistent value framing across contexts
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same reward presented very differently in different places
    - Value messaging contradicts actual reward behavior
    - Confusing value comparisons between reward types
    remediation: |
      - Standardize value presentation framework
      - Ensure consistency across all touchpoints
      - Create clear value hierarchy communication
  low:
  - id: RVPRC-LOW-001
    signal: No formal value perception testing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reward presentation designed without user testing
    - No baseline measurement of perception accuracy
    remediation: |
      - Implement perception testing for reward design
      - Establish baseline metrics for ongoing monitoring
  positive:
  - id: RVPRC-POS-001
    signal: Transparent and accurate value communication
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear explanation of what rewards provide
    - Accurate comparisons to alternatives
    - User perception closely matches actual value
    - Satisfaction maintained after acquisition
  - id: RVPRC-POS-002
    signal: Ethical framing that enhances rather than deceives
    evidence_indicators:
    - Presentation helps users understand genuine value
    - Excitement generated by actual quality, not manipulation
    - Users report feeling informed in decisions
