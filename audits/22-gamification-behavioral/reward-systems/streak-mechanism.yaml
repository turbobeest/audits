  what: |
    Assesses streak mechanisms that reward consecutive engagement,
    evaluating whether they support healthy habit formation or
    exploit loss aversion to create anxiety-driven compulsion.
    Examines streak freezes, recovery options, and psychological
    safety nets.
  why_it_matters: |
    Streaks tap into loss aversion - users feel losses 2x more
    intensely than equivalent gains. This creates powerful
    motivation but also significant risk:

    Positive outcomes:
    - Users with 7-day streaks are 2.3x more likely to return
    - Effective for building genuine habits
    - Can drive meaningful behavior change

    Negative outcomes:
    - Anxiety and stress about losing streaks
    - Compulsive behavior rather than genuine motivation
    - Users feeling trapped by their own progress
    - Engagement driven by fear rather than enjoyment
  when_to_run:
  - When designing streak mechanics
  - After user feedback about streak anxiety
  - When observing compulsive engagement patterns
  - During ethical review of retention features
  - Before launching new streak-based systems

  assessment_tools:
  - tool: Streak Mechanic Analysis
    purpose: Evaluate streak design characteristics
    description: |
      Assess: requirement difficulty, forgiveness mechanisms,
      notification tone, loss recovery options, milestone
      rewards vs. loss penalties. Rate each dimension for
      user-friendliness.
  - tool: Loss Impact Assessment
    purpose: Measure psychological impact of streak loss
    description: |
      Analyze: post-loss churn rates, re-engagement patterns,
      support complaints, user sentiment in reviews. Compare
      to users who never had streaks.
  - tool: Anxiety Indicator Detection
    purpose: Identify signs of unhealthy engagement
    description: |
      Look for: last-minute engagement spikes, late-night/
      early-morning activity anomalies, multiple daily checks,
      panic-driven support requests.
signals:
  critical:
  - id: STRK-CRIT-001
    signal: Streak mechanics designed primarily to exploit loss aversion
    evidence_indicators:
    - No forgiveness or recovery mechanisms
    - Harsh loss notifications emphasizing failure
    - Design docs cite anxiety as engagement driver
    - High post-loss churn indicating emotional damage
    explanation: |
      Streaks that punish without forgiveness and emphasize loss
      are designed to trap users through fear rather than motivate
      through genuine habit formation. This is manipulative.
    remediation: |
      - Implement streak freezes or protection
      - Soften loss messaging to encourage restart
      - Add grace periods for near-misses
      - Focus on building habits, not punishing breaks
  - id: STRK-CRIT-002
    signal: Streaks causing documented anxiety and compulsive behavior
    evidence_indicators:
    - User reports of significant stress from streaks
    - Late-night/vacation engagement to maintain streaks
    - Users describe feeling trapped
    - Mental health concerns raised
    explanation: |
      When users exhibit anxiety and compulsion rather than
      positive motivation, the mechanic has crossed from helpful
      to harmful.
    remediation: |
      - Add easy opt-out from streak tracking
      - Implement automatic pauses for detected breaks
      - Provide mental health-conscious messaging
      - Make streaks supportive rather than demanding
  high:
  - id: STRK-HIGH-001
    signal: Insufficient protection mechanisms for accidental loss
    evidence_indicators:
    - No streak freeze feature
    - No grace period for timezone/technical issues
    - One missed day destroys long streak
    - No recovery or restart incentives
    explanation: |
      Users who lose long streaks to accidents, travel, or illness
      feel betrayed and often churn permanently. Lack of protection
      prioritizes metrics over user wellbeing.
    remediation: |
      - Add streak freeze (free and purchasable)
      - Implement grace periods
      - Allow streak recovery within window
      - Make restart feel achievable
  - id: STRK-HIGH-002
    signal: Loss-framed notifications creating urgency anxiety
    evidence_indicators:
    - Notifications emphasize 'you'll LOSE your streak'
    - Countdown timers creating time pressure
    - Multiple notifications about impending loss
    - Guilt-inducing language about letting streak die
    explanation: |
      Notifications that emphasize loss and create urgency exploit
      loss aversion rather than supporting positive habits.
    remediation: |
      - Reframe notifications positively
      - Reduce notification frequency
      - Remove countdown anxiety
      - Focus on progress, not potential loss
  medium:
  - id: STRK-MED-001
    signal: Streak requirements difficult to maintain sustainably
    evidence_indicators:
    - Daily engagement required with no flexibility
    - High effort threshold for streak maintenance
    - No accommodation for weekends/holidays
    remediation: |
      - Lower minimum engagement for streak
      - Allow some flexibility in timing
      - Consider weekly streaks for lower-frequency products
  - id: STRK-MED-002
    signal: Streak milestone rewards disproportionate to loss impact
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long streak rewards modest
    - Losing streak feels catastrophic
    - Restart feels impossible after loss
    remediation: |
      - Increase milestone rewards to feel worthwhile
      - Reduce emotional impact of loss
      - Provide meaningful restart incentives
  low:
  - id: STRK-LOW-001
    signal: Streak impact on user wellbeing not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No user research on streak experience
    - No tracking of anxiety indicators
    - Only engagement metrics measured
    remediation: |
      - Research user emotional experience
      - Track wellbeing indicators alongside engagement
      - Balance metrics with user satisfaction
  positive:
  - id: STRK-POS-001
    signal: Streak design supports healthy habit formation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Generous forgiveness mechanisms
    - Positive, encouraging messaging
    - Users report feeling motivated, not anxious
    - Easy opt-out available
  - id: STRK-POS-002
    signal: Strong safety nets for streak protection
    evidence_indicators:
    - Free streak freezes available
    - Grace periods for accidents
    - Supportive loss recovery experience
    - No punitive loss messaging
