signals:
  critical:
  - id: ENGEX-CRIT-001
    signal: Business model fundamentally exploitative
    evidence_indicators:
    - Revenue requires extracting more than providing
    - User harm is acceptable for growth
    - Metrics prioritize extraction over value
    - No consideration for user wellbeing in decisions
    explanation: |
      When the business model requires exploitation to succeed,
      ethical engagement is structurally impossible.
    remediation: |
      - Reassess business model alignment
      - Find value-aligned revenue
      - Build wellbeing into metrics
      - Consider if business should exist as-is
  - id: ENGEX-CRIT-002
    signal: Engagement tactics deliberately exploit vulnerabilities
    evidence_indicators:
    - Known psychological vulnerabilities targeted
    - Manipulation techniques documented in design
    - Vulnerable populations specifically targeted
    - Harm documented and accepted
    explanation: |
      Deliberately exploiting vulnerabilities is unethical
      regardless of business justification.
    remediation: |
      - Remove exploitative mechanics
      - Add protections for vulnerable users
      - Redesign for ethical engagement
      - Establish ethical boundaries
  high:
  - id: ENGEX-HIGH-001
    signal: Metrics misaligned with user value
    evidence_indicators:
    - Success measured by time not satisfaction
    - No wellbeing metrics in dashboards
    - Engagement prioritized over value delivery
    explanation: |
      Measuring the wrong things leads to optimizing for
      extraction over value.
    remediation: |
      - Add satisfaction and wellbeing metrics
      - Balance time metrics with value metrics
      - Tie success to user outcomes
  - id: ENGEX-HIGH-002
    signal: User value doesn't match engagement investment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users invest more time than value received
    - Engagement exceeds goal achievement
    - Users describe regret about time spent
    explanation: |
      When engagement exceeds value, users are being exploited
      even if metrics look positive.
    remediation: |
      - Increase value delivery
      - Reduce unnecessary engagement
      - Align engagement with user goals
  medium:
  - id: ENGEX-MED-001
    signal: Pressure for engagement metrics creates ethical tension
    evidence_indicators:
    - Teams pressured to increase engagement
    - Ethical concerns raised but overridden
    - Growth targets conflict with wellbeing
    remediation: |
      - Set ethical boundaries on metrics pressure
      - Include wellbeing in targets
      - Support ethical decision-making
  - id: ENGEX-MED-002
    signal: User value not explicitly designed for
    evidence_indicators:
    - Value assumed but not measured
    - No clear user benefit articulation
    - Engagement design precedes value design
    remediation: |
      - Articulate clear user value
      - Design value before engagement
      - Measure value delivery
  positive:
  - id: ENGEX-POS-001
    signal: Engagement aligned with user value
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users achieve their goals through engagement
    - Value metrics alongside engagement metrics
