  what: |
    Assesses whether users can stop engaging at natural points
    without losing progress, facing penalties, or feeling trapped.
    Evaluates respect for user autonomy to disengage.
  why_it_matters: |
    Accessible quit points:
    - Respect user time and autonomy
    - Support healthy engagement patterns
    - Build trust through respect
    - Allow life priorities

    Inaccessible quit points:
    - Trap users in longer sessions
    - Create anxiety about stopping
    - Prioritize metrics over wellbeing
    - Disrespect user life constraints
  when_to_run:
  - When designing session boundaries
  - After complaints about inability to stop
  - During wellness design reviews
  - When evaluating friction to disengage

  access_requirements:
  - Product designer interviews
  - Session structure documentation

  interviews:
  - role: Product Designer
    questions:
    - How can users stop at any point?
    - What happens to progress when users stop?
    - Are there penalties for early stopping?
    - What are the natural session boundaries?
    purpose: Understand quit point design
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Session structure
    purpose: Identify quit points
    look_for:
    - Natural stopping points
    - Save mechanics
    - Penalties for stopping
  - type: User feedback
    purpose: Assess experience
    look_for:
    - Complaints about unable to stop
    - Lost progress reports
    - Feeling trapped

signals:
  critical:
  - id: QTPNT-CRIT-001
    signal: No ability to stop without significant penalty
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progress lost if user stops
    - Significant penalties for early quit
    - Designed to trap users in sessions
    - Users describe feeling unable to stop
    explanation: |
      Penalizing stopping traps users and disrespects their
      autonomy over their own time.
    remediation: |
      - Add save points throughout content
      - Remove penalties for stopping
      - Respect user decision to disengage
  high:
  - id: QTPNT-HIGH-001
    signal: Quit points spaced too far apart
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long stretches without save opportunity
    - Users must commit large time blocks
    - No natural stopping boundaries
    explanation: |
      Infrequent quit points force longer commitments than
      users may intend.
    remediation: |
      - Add more frequent save points
      - Create natural session boundaries
      - Allow stopping anytime
  - id: QTPNT-HIGH-002
    signal: Social mechanics prevent quitting
    evidence_indicators:
    - Team commitments can't be exited
    - Social pressure to continue
    - Others affected by user stopping
    explanation: |
      Social pressure to continue disrespects user autonomy
      and creates unhealthy obligation.
    remediation: |
      - Allow exiting social activities
      - Don't penalize teams for departures
      - Support individual autonomy
  medium:
  - id: QTPNT-MED-001
    signal: Dark patterns discourage quitting
    evidence_indicators:
    - Manipulation at quit prompts
    - Confirmshaming when leaving
    - Friction to exit vs. continue
    remediation: |
      - Remove manipulation from quit flows
      - Make exiting as easy as continuing
      - Respect user decisions
  - id: QTPNT-MED-002
    signal: Quit points unclear or hidden
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users don't know they can stop
    - Save/exit options hard to find
    - How to stop not obvious
    remediation: |
      - Make quit options visible
      - Clearly communicate save mechanics
      - Help users understand how to stop
  positive:
  - id: QTPNT-POS-001
    signal: Easy, penalty-free disengagement
    evidence_indicators:
    - Frequent save points
    - No penalties for stopping
    - Clear exit options
    - Users feel free to disengage
