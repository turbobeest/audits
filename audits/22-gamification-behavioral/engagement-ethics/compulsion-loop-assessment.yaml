  what: |
    Comprehensively assesses engagement mechanics for compulsion loop
    patterns that create addiction-like behavior. Evaluates the
    distinction between healthy engagement and exploitative mechanics
    that prioritize engagement metrics over user wellbeing.
  why_it_matters: |
    Compulsion loops can cause serious harm:
    - Addiction-like behavioral patterns
    - Time lost from meaningful activities
    - Mental health impacts
    - Financial harm from spending compulsion
    - Relationship and life damage

    Ethical engagement:
    - Respects user autonomy
    - Supports genuine goals
    - Allows healthy disengagement
    - Prioritizes wellbeing over metrics
  when_to_run:
  - When designing core engagement loops
  - After addiction concerns raised
  - During ethics reviews
  - When engagement metrics seem unhealthy

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CMPLS-CRIT-001
    signal: Engagement loop deliberately designed for addiction
    evidence_indicators:
    - Design docs cite addiction research for engagement
    - Variable reward schedules without safeguards
    - Friction deliberately removed for endless use
    - Metrics optimize for time, not satisfaction
    - FOMO/loss aversion central to loop
    explanation: |
      Deliberately designing for addiction prioritizes metrics
      over human wellbeing and causes real harm.
    remediation: |
      - Redesign loops for satisfaction not compulsion
      - Add meaningful stopping points
      - Implement usage controls
      - Shift metrics to wellbeing measures
  - id: CMPLS-CRIT-002
    signal: Evidence of addiction-like patterns in user base
    evidence_indicators:
    - Significant users with extreme usage patterns
    - Users report inability to control use
    - Life impacts from overuse documented
    - Mental health concerns raised
    explanation: |
      Observable addiction-like patterns indicate the product
      is causing harm that requires intervention.
    remediation: |
      - Implement usage limits and controls
      - Identify and support at-risk users
      - Redesign compulsion-inducing features
      - Provide resources for affected users
  high:
  - id: CMPLS-HIGH-001
    signal: No natural stopping points in engagement loop
    evidence_indicators:
    - Infinite scroll or continuous content
    - Autoplay without opt-out
    - No session boundaries
    - Active friction removal
    explanation: |
      Removing stopping points removes user agency over their
      own time and attention.
    remediation: |
      - Add natural stopping points
      - Implement session boundaries
      - Make autoplay opt-in
      - Respect user control
  - id: CMPLS-HIGH-002
    signal: Loss aversion central to engagement
    evidence_indicators:
    - Streaks with harsh loss penalties
    - FOMO messaging for engagement
    - Expiring content creating urgency
    - Loss framing dominates communication
    explanation: |
      Loss aversion-based engagement creates anxiety rather
      than enjoyment.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce loss aversion mechanics
      - Add streak protection
      - Remove artificial urgency
      - Frame positively not negatively
  medium:
  - id: CMPLS-MED-001
    signal: Variable rewards without transparency
    evidence_indicators:
    - Random rewards drive checking behavior
    - Unpredictability creates compulsive checking
    - Reward schedules not disclosed
    remediation: |
      - Add transparency to reward timing
      - Reduce variable reward intensity
      - Provide predictable alternatives
  - id: CMPLS-MED-002
    signal: Social pressure elements in loop
    evidence_indicators:
    - Social obligations drive return
    - Fear of letting others down
    - Social comparison creates anxiety
    remediation: |
      - Reduce social pressure mechanics
      - Allow async social engagement
      - Don't penalize others for user absence
  low:
  - id: CMPLS-LOW-001
    signal: User wellbeing not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only engagement metrics tracked
    - No satisfaction or regret measurement
    - Wellbeing impacts unknown
    remediation: |
      - Track wellbeing metrics
      - Measure satisfaction alongside engagement
      - Monitor for compulsion indicators
  positive:
  - id: CMPLS-POS-001
    signal: Engagement respects user wellbeing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Natural stopping points
    - Usage controls available
    - Users describe healthy relationship
    - Metrics include satisfaction not just time
