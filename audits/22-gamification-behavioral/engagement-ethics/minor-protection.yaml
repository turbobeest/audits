description:
  what: |
    Assesses protections for minors from potentially harmful
    gamification, monetization, and engagement mechanics. Evaluates
    age verification, parental controls, and age-appropriate design.
  why_it_matters: |
    Minors are especially vulnerable to:
    - Addictive engagement mechanics
    - Social pressure and comparison
    - Virtual currency confusion
    - Spending without understanding value
    - Psychological manipulation

    Ethical products targeting or accessible to minors must
    implement appropriate safeguards.
  when_to_run:
  - When product is accessible to minors
  - Before launching child-accessible features
  - During COPPA/child safety compliance reviews
  - After concerns about minor impact

    duration: 30 min
  - role: Legal/Compliance
    questions:
    - What regulatory requirements apply?

    - How is the experience different for minors?
    - What features are restricted for younger users?
    - How do parental controls work?
    purpose: Understand implementation

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MNRPR-CRIT-001
    signal: Exploitative mechanics targeting minors
    evidence_indicators:
    - Addictive mechanics in child-targeted content
    - No age-based restrictions on harmful features
    - Monetization pressure on minors
    - Design specifically exploits child psychology
    explanation: |
      Deliberately exploiting minors is unethical and likely
      illegal under child protection laws.
    remediation: |
      - Remove exploitative mechanics for minors
      - Implement strict age-appropriate design
      - Add age verification and restrictions
  - id: MNRPR-CRIT-002
    signal: No meaningful age verification for harmful content
    evidence_indicators:
    - Self-reported age only
    - Easily bypassed verification
    - No verification for monetization
    - Known minor access to harmful features
    explanation: |
      Without meaningful verification, harmful content and
      mechanics reach vulnerable minors.
    remediation: |
      - Implement meaningful age verification
      - Require parental consent for minor features
      - Default to child-safe experiences
  - id: MNRPR-CRIT-003
    signal: Unlimited spending accessible to minors
    evidence_indicators:
    - No spending limits for minor accounts
    - No parental approval for purchases
    - Easy access to purchasing without controls
    explanation: |
      Minors cannot fully understand purchase value and need
      protection from unlimited spending.
    remediation: |
      - Implement spending limits for minors
      - Require parental approval for purchases
      - Default to no-purchase experience
  high:
  - id: MNRPR-HIGH-001
    signal: No parental controls available
    evidence_indicators:
    - No parent account linking
    - No time or spending limits
    - No content filtering options
    - Parents cannot monitor usage
    explanation: |
      Parents need tools to protect their children when
      products are accessible to minors.
    remediation: |
      - Implement parental controls
      - Allow time and spending limits
      - Provide usage monitoring
  - id: MNRPR-HIGH-002
    signal: Same engagement mechanics for all ages
    evidence_indicators:
    - No age-based modification of features
    - Same addictive mechanics for children
    - Same social pressure features
    explanation: |
      Children need age-appropriate design, not adult engagement
      mechanics.
    remediation: |
      - Design age-appropriate experiences
      - Reduce engagement intensity for minors
      - Remove social pressure for younger users
  medium:
  - id: MNRPR-MED-001
    signal: Parental controls difficult to use
    evidence_indicators:
    - Controls exist but hard to find
    - Setup is complicated
    - Controls don't work effectively
    remediation: |
      - Make controls easy to find and use
      - Simplify setup process
      - Ensure controls work reliably
  - id: MNRPR-MED-002
    signal: Age-appropriate design not comprehensive
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some features modified but not others
    - Inconsistent protection
    - Gaps in age-appropriate design
    remediation: |
      - Audit all features for age-appropriateness
      - Implement consistent protection
      - Close gaps in coverage
  positive:
  - id: MNRPR-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive minor protection
    evidence_indicators:
    - Meaningful age verification
    - Robust parental controls
    - Age-appropriate design throughout
    - Spending and time protections
