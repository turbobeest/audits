description:
  what: |
    Assesses whether users are given accurate information about
    time requirements before committing to activities, content,
    or progression goals. Evaluates honesty about time investment.
  why_it_matters: |
    Time transparency enables:
    - Informed decisions about engagement
    - Respect for user schedules
    - Trust in the platform
    - Healthy time management

    Hidden time requirements:
    - Trap users in longer commitments than expected
    - Disrespect user time and autonomy
    - Create regret and frustration
    - Undermine informed consent
  when_to_run:
  - When designing time-based content
  - After complaints about unexpected time requirements
  - During user experience reviews
  - When evaluating content labeling
prerequisites:
  required_artifacts:
  - type: content_catalog
    description: Content with actual time requirements
  - type: time_estimates
    description: Any displayed time estimates
  access_requirements:
  - Product designer interviews
  - Actual vs. estimated time data
  - User feedback
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Product Designer
    questions:
    - How do you communicate time requirements?
    - How accurate are time estimates?
    - Do you warn users before long commitments?
    - Can users leave activities and resume?
    purpose: Understand time transparency design
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Time estimates
    purpose: Compare estimates to reality
    look_for:
    - Displayed time estimates
    - Actual completion times
    - Accuracy of estimates
  - type: User feedback
    purpose: Assess perception
    look_for:
    - Complaints about time requirements
    - Surprise at activity length
    - Satisfaction with time communication

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TMINV-CRIT-001
    signal: Deliberately hidden time requirements
    evidence_indicators:
    - No time estimates for long activities
    - Underestimated times to encourage starts
    - Design docs cite hidden time as engagement tactic
    - Users frequently trapped in longer activities
    explanation: |
      Hiding time requirements disrespects user autonomy and
      traps them in commitments they didn't consent to.
    remediation: |
      - Provide accurate time estimates
      - Warn before long commitments
      - Allow saves/pauses for all content
  high:
  - id: TMINV-HIGH-001
    signal: Time estimates significantly understate reality
    evidence_indicators:
    - Actual time 2x+ estimated time
    - Consistent underestimation
    - Users frustrated by time overruns
    explanation: |
      Underestimating time misleads users and wastes their time.
    remediation: |
      - Calibrate estimates accurately
      - Include buffer for variation
      - Track and improve estimate accuracy
  - id: TMINV-HIGH-002
    signal: No ability to save/pause long activities
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long activities with no save points
    - Progress lost if users must stop
    - Users must commit significant blocks
    explanation: |
      Requiring uninterrupted time blocks disrespects user
      constraints and creates frustration.
    remediation: |
      - Add save points to long content
      - Allow pausing and resuming
      - Respect user time constraints
  medium:
  - id: TMINV-MED-001
    signal: Time information not shown before commitment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Time only shown after starting
    - Users surprised by requirements
    - No pre-commitment information
    remediation: |
      - Show time before starting
      - Allow informed decisions
      - Preview commitment requirements
  - id: TMINV-MED-002
    signal: Cumulative time not communicated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Individual times shown, total hidden
    - Users don't realize cumulative investment
    - Series/progression time unclear
    remediation: |
      - Show cumulative time for series/progressions
      - Help users understand total investment
      - Provide progress tracking
  positive:
  - id: TMINV-POS-001
    signal: Transparent, accurate time communication
    evidence_indicators:
    - Accurate time estimates provided
    - Users can make informed decisions
    - Save/pause always available
    - Time expectations met
