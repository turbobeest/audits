description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the extent and effectiveness of linting tool coverage across
    the codebase. Examines linter configuration, rule enablement, file
    exclusions, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure consistent code
    quality standards are applied comprehensively.
  why_it_matters: |
    Incomplete linting coverage allows inconsistent code patterns, potential
    bugs, and style violations to enter the codebase undetected. Gaps in
    linting can lead to technical debt accumulation, harder code reviews,
    and reduced maintainability over time.
  when_to_run:
  - Initial codebase assessment
  - After adding new directories or modules
  - When onboarding new linting tools
  - Periodic quality gate validation

signals:
  critical:
  - id: LINT-CRIT-001
    signal: No linting configuration present for primary language
    evidence_pattern: Absence of linter config files for main source language
    explanation: |
      A codebase without linting has no automated quality gates for
      common bugs, style issues, and anti-patterns. This creates
      significant technical debt risk.
    remediation: Configure appropriate linter for primary language with recommended ruleset
  high:
  - id: LINT-HIGH-001
    signal: Large portions of codebase excluded from linting
    evidence_pattern: ignorePatterns|exclude.*\[.*\]
    explanation: |
      Excluding significant code from linting creates blind spots
      where quality issues can accumulate undetected.
    remediation: Review exclusions and minimize to truly auto-generated code only
  - id: LINT-HIGH-002
    signal: Linting not enforced in CI/CD pipeline
    evidence_pattern: CI config without lint step
    explanation: |
      Without CI enforcement, linting becomes optional and
      violations will inevitably enter the codebase.
    remediation: Add linting as required CI step that blocks merges on failure
  medium:
  - id: LINT-MED-001
    signal: Excessive inline lint suppressions
    evidence_pattern: eslint-disable|pylint:\s*disable
    remediation: Review suppressions for validity; fix underlying issues where possible
  - id: LINT-MED-002
    signal: Outdated or deprecated linting rules
    remediation: Update linter configuration to current best practices
  low:
  - id: LINT-LOW-001
    signal: Inconsistent linting configuration across modules
  positive:
  - id: LINT-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive linting with CI enforcement and minimal exclusions
