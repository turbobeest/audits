description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the automated code review tools and checks integrated into the
    development workflow. Analyzes linter configurations, static analysis tools,
    security scanners, and AI-assisted review tools. Measures the effectiveness
    of automated checks in catching issues before human review.
  why_it_matters: |
    Automated review tools catch 30-50% of defects that would otherwise consume
    human reviewer time. They provide consistent enforcement of standards,
    eliminate subjective style debates, and scale review capacity. Organizations
    with comprehensive automated review report 40% reduction in review cycle time
    and more focused human reviews on logic and design.
  when_to_run:
  - Initial project setup review
  - After adding new languages or frameworks
  - During CI/CD pipeline improvements
  - Quarterly tooling assessments

signals:
  critical:
  - id: AR-CRIT-001
    signal: No automated code review tools configured
    evidence_pattern: no_linters_found && no_static_analysis
    explanation: |
      Complete absence of automated review tools means all quality checks
      rely on human review, which is inconsistent, time-consuming, and
      misses many detectable issues.
    remediation: Implement at minimum linting and basic static analysis
  high:
  - id: AR-HIGH-001
    signal: Linters configured but not enforced in CI
    evidence_pattern: linter_config_exists && !ci_linter_step
    explanation: |
      Linter configuration exists but isn't enforced, allowing developers
      to bypass checks and merge non-compliant code.
    remediation: Add linter execution as required CI check
  - id: AR-HIGH-002
    signal: Security scanners missing from automated checks
    evidence_pattern: no_security_scanner
    explanation: |
      No automated security analysis leaves vulnerability detection
      entirely to human review, which frequently misses security issues.
    remediation: Add SAST tools like Semgrep, CodeQL, or Snyk
  medium:
  - id: AR-MED-001
    signal: Automated checks don't block merge
    evidence_pattern: checks_not_required
    remediation: Configure branch protection to require passing checks
  - id: AR-MED-002
    signal: Limited language coverage in automated tools
    evidence_pattern: language_coverage < 80%
    remediation: Add appropriate tools for all project languages
  low:
  - id: AR-LOW-001
    signal: Outdated tool versions
    evidence_pattern: tool_version_outdated
    remediation: Update to latest stable versions of review tools
  positive:
  - id: AR-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive automated review suite
    evidence_pattern: linting && sast && formatting && tests
  - id: AR-POS-002
    signal: AI-assisted review tools in use
