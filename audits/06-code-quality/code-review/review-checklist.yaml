  what: |
    Evaluates the presence and effectiveness of review checklists that guide
    reviewers through consistent evaluation criteria. Analyzes PR templates,
    review guides, and checklist completion rates. Identifies gaps in review
    coverage and checklist compliance.
  why_it_matters: |
    Checklists reduce cognitive load and ensure consistent review quality
    across all reviewers. Aviation and medical research shows checklists
    reduce errors by 35-47%. Code review checklists ensure security,
    performance, and maintainability considerations aren't overlooked under
    time pressure.

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RCL-CRIT-001
    signal: No review checklist or guidelines exist
    evidence_pattern: no_pr_template && no_review_docs
    explanation: |
      Without structured guidance, reviewers rely entirely on memory
      and personal judgment, leading to inconsistent and incomplete reviews.
    remediation: Create PR template with review checklist
  high:
  - id: RCL-HIGH-001
    signal: Checklist missing security considerations
    evidence_pattern: no_security_items
    explanation: |
      Review checklist doesn't prompt reviewers to consider security
      implications, increasing risk of security issues slipping through.
    remediation: Add security-specific checklist items
  - id: RCL-HIGH-002
    signal: Checklist items frequently unchecked
    evidence_pattern: completion_rate < 50%
    explanation: |
      Low checklist completion suggests items are ignored or the
      checklist is too burdensome, defeating its purpose.
    remediation: Simplify checklist and enforce completion
  medium:
  - id: RCL-MED-001
    signal: Checklist too long (>15 items)
    evidence_pattern: checklist_items > 15
    remediation: Consolidate checklist to most critical items
  - id: RCL-MED-002
    signal: Generic checklist not tailored to project
    evidence_pattern: generic_template
    remediation: Customize checklist to project-specific concerns
  low:
  - id: RCL-LOW-001
    signal: Checklist not versioned or dated
    evidence_pattern: no_version_info
    remediation: Add version tracking to checklist
  positive:
  - id: RCL-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive checklist covering all quality aspects
    evidence_pattern: security && performance && testing && docs
  - id: RCL-POS-002
    signal: High checklist completion rate (>90%)
    evidence_pattern: completion_rate >= 90%
