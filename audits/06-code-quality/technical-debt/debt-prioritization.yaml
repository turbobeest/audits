description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the prioritization framework and practices for technical debt
    remediation. Reviews criteria used for prioritization, alignment with
    business goals, balance between debt types, and consistency of application.
    Ensures debt work is allocated to highest-impact items.
  why_it_matters: |
    Not all debt is equal - some has severe impact while other is benign.
    Effective prioritization ensures limited remediation capacity addresses
    highest-impact debt first. Without systematic prioritization, teams either
    avoid all debt work or address low-impact items while critical debt
    compounds. ROI-based prioritization maximizes value of debt reduction.
  when_to_run:
  - Sprint planning
  - Quarterly planning
  - When debt backlog grows large
  - After major incidents

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PRIO-CRIT-001
    signal: No prioritization framework
    evidence_pattern: absence of prioritization criteria
    explanation: |
      Debt items are not prioritized systematically. This leads to
      random selection and missed high-impact opportunities.
    remediation: Implement prioritization framework (ICE, RICE, or custom)
  - id: PRIO-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical debt not prioritized
    evidence_pattern: high-impact debt without priority
    explanation: |
      Debt known to have critical impact is not prioritized for
      remediation, allowing severe issues to persist.
    remediation: Ensure all critical-impact debt has high priority
  high:
  - id: PRIO-HIGH-001
    signal: Inconsistent prioritization
    evidence_pattern: mixed prioritization approaches
    explanation: |
      Different debt items prioritized using different criteria,
      making comparison and selection inconsistent.
    remediation: Standardize prioritization criteria across all debt
  - id: PRIO-HIGH-002
    signal: Stale priorities
    evidence_pattern: priorities not updated after changes
    explanation: |
      Priorities set long ago may no longer reflect current
      business needs or impact understanding.
    remediation: Review and update priorities regularly
  medium:
  - id: PRIO-MED-001
    signal: Impact not factored in priority
    evidence_pattern: priority without impact assessment
    remediation: Include impact in prioritization criteria
  - id: PRIO-MED-002
    signal: Effort not estimated
    evidence_pattern: prioritized items without effort
    remediation: Add effort estimates for ROI calculation
  low:
  - id: PRIO-LOW-001
    signal: Missing documentation
    evidence_pattern: prioritization criteria undocumented
    remediation: Document prioritization framework and criteria
  positive:
  - id: PRIO-POS-001
    signal: Clear prioritization framework
    evidence_pattern: documented criteria consistently applied
  - id: PRIO-POS-002
    signal: ROI-based prioritization
    evidence_pattern: impact and effort both considered
  - id: PRIO-POS-003
    signal: Regular priority reviews
    evidence_pattern: priorities updated periodically
