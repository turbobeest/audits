description:
  what: |
    Analyzes the impact of technical debt on development velocity, system
    reliability, developer experience, and business outcomes. Quantifies the
    cost of debt in terms of time spent on workarounds, bugs caused by debt,
    and opportunities foregone. Provides data for prioritization decisions.
  why_it_matters: |
    Understanding debt impact enables ROI-based prioritization. Ward Cunningham's
    original debt metaphor emphasized interest payments - the ongoing cost of
    living with debt. Without impact assessment, teams cannot justify debt
    reduction investment or prioritize effectively. Impact data transforms
    abstract debt into concrete business costs.
  when_to_run:
  - Before major prioritization decisions
  - Budget planning cycles
  - After incidents caused by debt
  - Quarterly reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: IMP-CRIT-001
    signal: Debt causing production incidents
    evidence_pattern: incident linked to tech debt
    explanation: |
      Technical debt is directly causing production issues,
      indicating severe impact on reliability and user experience.
    remediation: Prioritize debt causing incidents for immediate remediation
  - id: IMP-CRIT-002
    signal: Debt blocking feature delivery
    evidence_pattern: feature blocked by debt
    explanation: |
      Technical debt is preventing feature development, directly
      impacting business value delivery.
    remediation: Address blocking debt before continuing feature work
  high:
  - id: IMP-HIGH-001
    signal: Significant time spent on workarounds
    evidence_pattern: multiple workaround comments
    explanation: |
      Developers regularly implement workarounds for debt,
      consuming time that could be spent on value delivery.
    remediation: Track workaround time and prioritize root cause fixes
  - id: IMP-HIGH-002
    signal: Debt concentrated in critical paths
    evidence_pattern: debt in hot paths or core modules
    explanation: |
      Technical debt exists in frequently modified or critical
      code paths, amplifying its impact.
    remediation: Prioritize debt reduction in critical paths

    remediation: Address debt causing developer experience issues
  - id: IMP-MED-002
    signal: Onboarding slowed by debt
    evidence_pattern: confusing code patterns
    remediation: Improve or document confusing debt areas
  low:
  - id: IMP-LOW-001
    signal: Impact not quantified
    evidence_pattern: debt without impact assessment
    remediation: Add impact estimates to debt inventory
  positive:
  - id: IMP-POS-001
    signal: Impact assessments documented
    evidence_pattern: debt items with impact ratings
  - id: IMP-POS-002
    signal: ROI-based prioritization
