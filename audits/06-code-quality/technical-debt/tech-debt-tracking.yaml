description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the processes, tools, and practices used to track technical debt
    over time. Assesses whether debt tracking is systematic, integrated into
    development workflows, and provides visibility to stakeholders. Reviews
    metrics, dashboards, and reporting mechanisms for debt management.
  why_it_matters: |
    Tracking debt without effective processes leads to stale inventories and
    ignored backlogs. Effective tracking requires integration with development
    workflows, regular updates, and stakeholder visibility. Studies show teams
    with systematic debt tracking make better prioritization decisions and
    maintain higher development velocity over time.
  when_to_run:
  - Process improvement initiatives
  - After tooling changes
  - During team retrospectives
  - Quarterly planning cycles

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEBT-TRK-CRIT-001
    signal: No debt tracking process
    evidence_pattern: absence of tracking mechanisms
    explanation: |
      Team has no systematic process for tracking technical debt.
      This leads to invisible accumulation and uninformed decisions.
    remediation: Implement debt tracking with labels, templates, and regular reviews
  high:
  - id: DEBT-TRK-HIGH-001
    signal: Tracking not integrated with workflow
    evidence_pattern: debt tracked separately from main workflow
    explanation: |
      Debt tracking exists but is not integrated into development
      workflow. Separate systems become stale and ignored.
    remediation: Integrate debt tracking into primary issue tracker and CI/CD
  - id: DEBT-TRK-HIGH-002
    signal: No visibility into debt metrics
    evidence_pattern: no dashboard or reporting
    explanation: |
      Debt is tracked but there's no visibility into trends,
      accumulation rate, or remediation progress.
    remediation: Create dashboards showing debt trends and metrics
  medium:
  - id: DEBT-TRK-MED-001
    signal: Manual tracking only
    evidence_pattern: no automated debt detection
    remediation: Implement automated debt detection via static analysis
  - id: DEBT-TRK-MED-002
    signal: Inconsistent labeling
    evidence_pattern: multiple debt labels without hierarchy
    remediation: Standardize debt labeling with clear taxonomy
  low:
  - id: DEBT-TRK-LOW-001
    signal: Missing historical data
    evidence_pattern: no debt trend history
    remediation: Implement debt metrics collection over time
  positive:
  - id: DEBT-TRK-POS-001
    signal: Automated debt tracking
    evidence_pattern: CI integration with debt metrics
  - id: DEBT-TRK-POS-002
    signal: Debt dashboard exists
    evidence_pattern: visible debt metrics and trends
  - id: DEBT-TRK-POS-003
    signal: Regular debt review process
    evidence_pattern: scheduled debt review meetings
