description:
  what: |
    Evaluates consistency and quality of naming conventions for variables,
    functions, classes, files, and other identifiers throughout the codebase.
    Checks for adherence to language-specific conventions and project standards.
  why_it_matters: |
    Consistent, descriptive naming is fundamental to code readability. Studies
    show developers spend 70% of coding time reading code. Poor naming increases
    comprehension time by 40% and leads to more bugs during modification.
    Martin Fowler: "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.
    Good programmers write code that humans can understand."

signals:
  critical:
  - id: NC-CRIT-001
    signal: Single-letter variable names in complex scopes
    evidence_pattern: single_char_var_complex
    explanation: |
      Single-letter variables outside of trivial loops destroy
      readability and make code extremely difficult to understand.
    remediation: Use descriptive names that reveal intent
  high:
  - id: NC-HIGH-001
    signal: Inconsistent casing conventions within file
    evidence_pattern: mixed_casing_same_file
    explanation: |
      Mixed naming conventions (camelCase and snake_case) in the same
      file indicate lack of consistency and make code harder to read.
    remediation: Standardize on single naming convention per language
  - id: NC-HIGH-002
    signal: Misleading or contradictory names
    evidence_pattern: misleading_names
    explanation: |
      Names that suggest one thing but do another are worse than
      vague names - they actively mislead readers.
    remediation: Rename to accurately reflect purpose
  medium:
  - id: NC-MED-001
    signal: Abbreviations that aren't universally understood
    evidence_pattern: unclear_abbreviations
    remediation: Spell out or document non-obvious abbreviations
  - id: NC-MED-002
    signal: Magic numbers or string literals
    evidence_pattern: magic_values
    remediation: Extract to named constants
  low:
  - id: NC-LOW-001
    signal: No naming convention linting configured
    evidence_pattern: no_naming_rules
    remediation: Add naming convention rules to linting
  positive:
  - id: NC-POS-001
    signal: Consistent naming across codebase
    evidence_pattern: naming_consistency > 95%
  - id: NC-POS-002
    signal: Descriptive, intention-revealing names
    evidence_pattern: descriptive_names
