description:
  what: |
    Evaluates README.md quality including essential sections, clarity,
    accuracy, and usefulness for new visitors. Reviews project description,
    installation instructions, usage examples, contribution guidelines,
    and license information.
  why_it_matters: |
    The README is typically the first documentation a visitor sees. Studies
    show that README quality significantly impacts project adoption. A good
    README answers "What is this?", "Why should I care?", "How do I use it?",
    and "How can I contribute?" within seconds of arrival. Poor READMEs
    drive away potential users and contributors.
