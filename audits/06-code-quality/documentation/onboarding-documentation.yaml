description:
  what: |
    Evaluates documentation designed to help new team members become productive
    quickly. Reviews getting started guides, development environment setup,
    contribution guidelines, codebase orientation, and learning paths. Assesses
    whether documentation enables self-service onboarding.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor onboarding documentation creates bottlenecks where new team members
    depend on existing members for basic information. This drains productivity
    from the whole team. Good onboarding docs enable new developers to become
    productive in days rather than weeks, reduce repeated explanations, and
    ensure consistent understanding across the team.
  when_to_run:
  - Before new hires join
  - After significant changes
  - Quarterly documentation reviews
  - When onboarding friction reported

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ONBOARD-CRIT-001
    signal: No setup documentation
    evidence_pattern: missing setup instructions
    explanation: |
      Project has no documented setup process, requiring
      new developers to reverse-engineer the environment.
    remediation: Create comprehensive setup guide with step-by-step instructions
  - id: ONBOARD-CRIT-002
    signal: Setup instructions don't work
    evidence_pattern: broken setup steps
    explanation: |
      Setup documentation exists but following it results
      in errors or incomplete environment.
    remediation: Test and fix setup instructions; add CI verification
  high:
  - id: ONBOARD-HIGH-001
    signal: Missing prerequisite documentation
    evidence_pattern: prerequisites not listed
    explanation: |
