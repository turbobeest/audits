description:
  what: |
    Analyzes the codebase for consistent adherence to naming conventions
    across variables, functions, classes, constants, and files. Checks for
    proper use of camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE,
    and kebab-case according to language-specific standards.
  why_it_matters: |
    Inconsistent naming conventions significantly impair code readability
    and maintainability. Studies show developers spend 60-70% of their time
    reading code, and consistent naming reduces cognitive load by 15-25%.
    Inconsistent naming causes confusion, increases onboarding time, and
    leads to bugs when similar names have different meanings.

  - During code reviews
  - When onboarding new team members
  - During style guide establishment

signals:
  critical:
  - id: NC-CRIT-001
    signal: Severely inconsistent naming across the codebase
    evidence_pattern: Multiple conflicting conventions in same file
    explanation: |
      Finding camelCase, snake_case, and PascalCase used interchangeably
      for the same type of identifier (e.g., variables) within files
      indicates severe style discipline breakdown.
    remediation: Establish and enforce style guide with linting tools
  - id: NC-CRIT-002
    signal: Misleading or deceptive variable names
    evidence_pattern: Names that suggest opposite meaning
    explanation: |
      Names like 'isEnabled' that actually track disabled state, or
      'userList' that contains a single user, cause serious bugs and
      confusion.
    remediation: Rename variables to accurately reflect their content
  high:
  - id: NC-HIGH-001
    signal: Single-character variable names outside loops
    evidence_pattern: \b[a-z]\s*=
    cwe: CWE-1099
    explanation: |
      Single-character names like 'x', 'a', 'd' provide no semantic meaning
      and force readers to track variable meaning manually, increasing
      cognitive load and bug risk.
    remediation: Use descriptive names that convey purpose
  - id: NC-HIGH-002
    signal: Inconsistent casing for same identifier type
    evidence_pattern: Mixed camelCase and snake_case for variables
    explanation: |
      Using different casing conventions for the same type of identifier
      (e.g., some functions camelCase, others snake_case) causes confusion.
    remediation: Standardize on one convention per identifier type
  medium:
  - id: NC-MED-001
    signal: Abbreviated names without context
    evidence_pattern: \b[a-z]{2,4}\b
    remediation: Expand abbreviations or add clarifying comments
  - id: NC-MED-002
    signal: Numbers in variable names suggesting sequence
    evidence_pattern: \b\w+[0-9]+\b
    remediation: Use meaningful names or collections
  low:
  - id: NC-LOW-001
    signal: Deprecated Hungarian notation usage
    evidence_pattern: (str|int|arr|obj|fn)[A-Z]
    remediation: Remove type prefixes from variable names
  positive:
  - id: NC-POS-001
    signal: Consistent naming conventions throughout codebase
  - id: NC-POS-002
    signal: Linting rules enforce naming standards
