  what: |
    Evaluates whether hosting infrastructure uses renewable energy and
    environmentally responsible practices. Assesses cloud provider
    renewable energy commitments, carbon offset programs, and actual
    vs. claimed sustainability practices.

    Examines provider sustainability claims, verification, and the
    actual environmental impact of hosting choices.
  why_it_matters: |
    Hosting provider choice significantly impacts environmental footprint:

    - Major cloud providers have different renewable energy levels
    - Green energy usage can dramatically reduce carbon footprint
    - Greenwashing vs. genuine sustainability varies widely
    - Customer pressure drives provider sustainability improvements
    - ESG and sustainability reporting requires understanding hosting impact
  when_to_run:
  - During cloud provider selection
  - For sustainability assessments
  - When ESG reporting requires hosting information
  - Annually for monitoring
prerequisites:
  required_artifacts:
  - type: hosting_documentation
    description: Documentation of hosting providers
  - type: provider_sustainability
    description: Provider sustainability reports and claims
  access_requirements:
  - Provider documentation
  - Sustainability reports
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Infrastructure Lead
    questions:
    - What hosting providers are used?
    - Was sustainability considered in selection?
    - What do providers claim about renewable energy?
    - Have you verified provider sustainability claims?
    purpose: Understand hosting choices and sustainability awareness
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Provider Sustainability Reports
    purpose: Review renewable energy claims
    look_for:
    - Renewable energy percentage
    - Carbon neutrality claims
    - Verification and certification
  - type: Third-Party Verification
    purpose: Assess claim credibility
    look_for:
    - Independent verification
    - RE100 membership
    - Carbon offset quality

signals:
  critical:
  - id: GREEN-CRIT-001
    signal: Hosting on providers with no renewable energy
    evidence_indicators:
    - Provider has no renewable energy commitment
    - High carbon grid with no offsets
    - No sustainability program
    - Sustainability not considered
    explanation: |
      Hosting on providers without renewable energy means maximum
      carbon impact from infrastructure when alternatives exist.
    remediation: |
      - Evaluate provider renewable energy levels
      - Consider migration to greener providers
      - Select green regions if available
  high:
  - id: GREEN-HIGH-001
    signal: Unverified green claims
    evidence_indicators:
    - Provider claims green without verification
    - Carbon neutral claims without transparency
    - No third-party certification
    - Greenwashing indicators
    explanation: |
      Unverified green claims may be greenwashing. Relying on
      unverified claims may mean actual environmental impact
      differs from expectations.
    remediation: |
      - Seek providers with verified claims
      - Look for RE100 membership
      - Request verification documentation
      - Assess offset quality
  - id: GREEN-HIGH-002
    signal: Low-quality carbon offsets
    evidence_indicators:
    - Offsets from questionable projects
    - No offset verification
    - Offsets instead of actual reduction
    - Poor additionality evidence
    explanation: |
      Low-quality offsets don't deliver claimed environmental benefits.
      Relying on poor offsets provides false sustainability impression.
    remediation: |
      - Prioritize actual renewable energy over offsets
      - Evaluate offset project quality
      - Seek verified offset programs
  medium:
  - id: GREEN-MED-001
    signal: Green regions available but not used
    evidence_indicators:
    - Provider offers green regions
    - Deployment in non-green regions
    - Sustainability not in region selection
    remediation: |
      - Evaluate green region availability
      - Consider migration to greener regions
      - Include sustainability in region criteria
  positive:
  - id: GREEN-POS-001
    signal: Verified green hosting
    evidence_indicators:
    - Provider 100% renewable or matched
    - Third-party verification
    - Transparent sustainability reporting
    - RE100 membership
