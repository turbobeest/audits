  what: |
    Evaluates compute resource optimization from an environmental perspective.
    Assesses whether workloads are right-sized, auto-scaling is efficient,
    spot/preemptible instances are utilized, and compute waste is minimized.
    Focuses on the environmental benefit of efficiency, not just cost.
  why_it_matters: |
    Compute efficiency directly reduces carbon footprint:

    - Over-provisioned resources waste energy
    - Efficient scaling matches resources to demand
    - Spot/preemptible instances use otherwise wasted capacity
    - Optimization reduces both cost and environmental impact
    - Every wasted CPU cycle has a carbon cost
  when_to_run:
  - During infrastructure optimization
  - When scaling significantly
  - For sustainability assessments
  - Quarterly for ongoing monitoring

    description: Resource utilization data
  - type: scaling_configuration
    description: Auto-scaling and provisioning settings
  access_requirements:
  - Resource utilization monitoring
  - Scaling configuration access
  - Interview access to infrastructure team
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Infrastructure Lead
    questions:
    - How do you right-size compute resources?
    - What auto-scaling strategies are used?
    - Do you use spot/preemptible instances?
    - What utilization targets do you have?
    purpose: Understand optimization practices
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Utilization Reports
    purpose: Assess resource efficiency
    look_for:
    - CPU utilization rates
    - Memory utilization
    - Idle resource time

signals:
  critical:
  - id: COMPUTE-CRIT-001
    signal: Significant compute resources idle or underutilized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Average utilization below 20%
    - Large instances with minimal load
    - Resources running 24/7 without need
    - No utilization monitoring
    explanation: |
      Idle or heavily underutilized compute resources waste energy
      and increase carbon footprint without providing value.
    remediation: |
      - Implement utilization monitoring
      - Right-size to actual needs
      - Use auto-scaling
      - Schedule non-production resources
  high:
  - id: COMPUTE-HIGH-001
    signal: No auto-scaling or demand matching
    evidence_indicators:
    - Fixed provisioning regardless of load
    - Peak capacity always allocated
    - No scaling to match demand
    explanation: |
      Without demand-matching, resources are wasted during low periods.
      Auto-scaling aligns resources with actual need.
    remediation: |
      - Implement auto-scaling
      - Scale down during low demand
      - Match provisioning to patterns
  - id: COMPUTE-HIGH-002
    signal: Spot/preemptible instances not considered
    evidence_indicators:
    - All on-demand instances
    - Spot viable but not used
    - Batch workloads on expensive instances
    explanation: |
      Spot/preemptible instances use otherwise wasted capacity,
      reducing both cost and environmental impact.
    remediation: |
      - Evaluate workloads for spot viability
      - Use spot for fault-tolerant workloads
      - Consider preemptible for batch processing
  medium:
  - id: COMPUTE-MED-001
    signal: Dev/test environments running continuously
    evidence_indicators:
    - Non-production running 24/7
    - No schedule-based scaling
    - Weekend/night resources running
    remediation: |
      - Schedule non-production environments
      - Spin down outside working hours
      - Use on-demand for dev/test
  positive:
  - id: COMPUTE-POS-001
    signal: Optimized compute with high utilization
    evidence_indicators:
    - Utilization targets met
    - Auto-scaling effective
    - Spot/preemptible utilized
    - Minimal waste
