description:
  what: |
    Evaluates algorithm and code efficiency from an environmental perspective.
    Assesses whether algorithms are optimized for energy consumption, whether
    expensive computation is justified, and whether ML models consider
    inference cost relative to benefit.

    Examines algorithm complexity, model efficiency, and the energy/value
    tradeoff of computational approaches.
  why_it_matters: |
    Algorithm efficiency directly impacts energy consumption:

    - Large ML models have significant training and inference costs
    - Inefficient algorithms multiply energy use at scale
    - Optimization can dramatically reduce environmental impact
    - AI energy consumption growing rapidly
    - Every computation has an energy and carbon cost
  when_to_run:
  - During algorithm design and review
  - When deploying ML models at scale
  - For sustainability assessments
  - When optimizing for efficiency

    signal: Large ML models without efficiency consideration
    evidence_indicators:
    - Very large models without accuracy justification
    - No evaluation of smaller alternatives
    - Inference cost not measured
    - Model size chosen without efficiency review
    explanation: |
      Large ML models can have orders of magnitude difference in
      energy consumption. Using larger models without considering
      efficient alternatives wastes energy.
    remediation: |
      - Evaluate smaller model alternatives
      - Measure accuracy vs. efficiency tradeoff
      - Consider distillation or quantization
      - Document efficiency decisions
  high:
  - id: ALGO-HIGH-001
    signal: Inefficient algorithms used at scale
    evidence_indicators:
    - O(n^2) or worse algorithms in hot paths
    - No profiling of high-frequency operations
    - Known inefficient implementations
    - Efficiency not in code review criteria
    explanation: |
      Inefficient algorithms at scale multiply energy use. A 2x
      efficiency improvement saves 50% of energy for that operation.
    remediation: |
      - Profile high-frequency operations
      - Review algorithm complexity
      - Optimize hot paths
      - Include efficiency in reviews
  - id: ALGO-HIGH-002
    signal: Expensive computation without proportional value
    evidence_indicators:
    - Heavy computation for minor features
    - Always-on expensive processing
    - Real-time processing where batch would suffice
    - Energy cost not considered in feature decisions
    explanation: |
      Expensive computation should deliver proportional value.
      Using heavy computation for minor features wastes energy.
    remediation: |
      - Evaluate computation/value ratio
      - Consider batch vs. real-time tradeoffs
      - Lazy computation where appropriate
      - Include energy cost in feature decisions
