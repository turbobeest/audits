description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the energy efficiency of data center infrastructure used by
    the software system. For cloud deployments, assesses cloud provider
    efficiency metrics, PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness), and renewable
    energy usage. For on-premises, evaluates direct facility efficiency.
  why_it_matters: |
    Data center efficiency directly impacts environmental footprint:

    - PUE differences can double or halve energy usage
    - Cloud provider choice affects sustainability
    - Efficient infrastructure reduces both cost and carbon
    - Growing regulatory focus on data center energy
    - ESG expectations include infrastructure efficiency
  when_to_run:
  - During cloud provider selection
  - When evaluating infrastructure changes
  - For sustainability assessments
  - Annually for monitoring
prerequisites:
  required_artifacts:
  - type: cloud_provider_info
    description: Information about cloud providers used
  - type: sustainability_reports
    description: Provider sustainability and efficiency reports
  access_requirements:
  - Cloud provider documentation
  - Provider sustainability reports
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Infrastructure Lead
    questions:
    - What cloud providers or data centers are used?
    - Was efficiency considered in provider selection?
    - What do you know about provider sustainability?
    purpose: Understand infrastructure choices
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Provider Sustainability Reports
    purpose: Review provider efficiency
    look_for:
    - PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness)
    - Renewable energy percentage
    - Efficiency investments

    signal: Using providers with poor efficiency metrics
    evidence_indicators:
    - PUE significantly above 1.5
    - No renewable energy
    - No efficiency improvement plans
    - Provider transparency lacking
    explanation: |
      Poor data center efficiency multiplies energy use and carbon
      impact. Using inefficient providers when alternatives exist
      represents unnecessary environmental impact.
    remediation: |
      - Evaluate provider efficiency metrics
      - Consider migration to more efficient providers
      - Engage providers on efficiency improvements
  high:
  - id: DCEFF-HIGH-001
    signal: Efficiency not considered in provider selection
    evidence_indicators:
    - Provider chosen without efficiency review
    - No PUE or renewable energy in criteria
    - Sustainability not in vendor evaluation
    explanation: |
      Ignoring efficiency in provider selection misses opportunity
      to reduce environmental impact through better choices.
    remediation: |
      - Add efficiency to provider selection criteria
      - Review current provider efficiency
      - Consider efficiency in future decisions
  medium:
  - id: DCEFF-MED-001
    signal: Provider efficiency not monitored
    evidence_indicators:
    - No ongoing tracking of provider efficiency
    - Efficiency improvements not monitored
    - No sustainability KPIs for infrastructure
    remediation: |
      - Track provider efficiency metrics over time
      - Include in infrastructure reviews
      - Set efficiency targets
  positive:
  - id: DCEFF-POS-001
    signal: Efficient providers with transparency
    evidence_indicators:
    - Providers with PUE near 1.2
    - High renewable energy usage
    - Regular efficiency reporting
    - Ongoing improvement demonstrated
