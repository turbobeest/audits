description:
  what: |
    Evaluates data retention practices from an environmental perspective.
    Assesses whether data is retained longer than necessary, whether
    storage tiers are optimized, and whether deletion policies reduce
    storage carbon footprint.

    Focuses on the environmental benefit of data minimization and efficient
    storage, complementing privacy-focused retention audits.
  why_it_matters: |
    Data storage has significant environmental impact:

    - Storage infrastructure consumes substantial energy
    - Retaining unnecessary data wastes resources
    - Cold storage tiers reduce active storage energy
    - Data growth is exponential - unchecked growth unsustainable
    - Storage optimization reduces both cost and carbon
  when_to_run:
  - During data lifecycle reviews
  - For sustainability assessments
  - When storage costs are significant
  - Annually for monitoring

  - Storage metrics access
  - Retention policy documentation
  - Interview access to data teams

  interviews:
  - role: Data Engineering Lead
    questions:
    - What are your data retention policies?
    - How much data is stored and for how long?
    - Do you use storage tiering?
    - How often is old data deleted?
    purpose: Understand retention practices
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Retention Policies
    purpose: Review retention periods
    look_for:
    - Retention periods by data type
    - Deletion enforcement
    - Storage tiering
  - type: Storage Metrics
    purpose: Assess storage efficiency

    - Total storage volume
    - Growth rates
    - Tier distribution

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DATARETENV-CRIT-001
    signal: Indefinite retention without business need
    evidence_indicators:
    - Data retained forever 'just in case'
    - No retention limits defined
    - Old data never deleted
    - Exponential storage growth unchecked
    explanation: |
      Indefinite retention of unnecessary data wastes storage energy
      and increases environmental footprint without providing value.
    remediation: |
      - Define retention periods for all data types
      - Implement automated deletion
      - Audit stored data for necessity
      - Set growth limits
  high:
  - id: DATARETENV-HIGH-001
    signal: No storage tiering for aged data
    evidence_indicators:
    - All data on hot storage
    - Cold storage not utilized
    - Archive tier not used
    - Old data on expensive/energy-intensive storage
    explanation: |
      Hot storage is more energy-intensive. Moving aged data to cold
      or archive tiers reduces ongoing energy consumption.
    remediation: |
      - Implement storage tiering policies
      - Move infrequently accessed data to cold storage
      - Use archive for long-term retention
  - id: DATARETENV-HIGH-002
    signal: Significant duplicate data stored
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple copies without deduplication
    - Backup redundancy excessive
    - Test data duplicating production
    explanation: |
      Duplicate data multiplies storage requirements and energy use
      without proportional value.
    remediation: |
      - Implement deduplication
      - Optimize backup redundancy
      - Use production data sampling for test
  medium:
  - id: DATARETENV-MED-001
    signal: Retention policies not enforced
    evidence_indicators:
    - Policies exist but deletion not automated
    - Data retained beyond policy limits
    - Manual deletion rarely performed
    remediation: |
      - Automate retention enforcement
      - Regular deletion audits
      - Monitor compliance with policies
  positive:
  - id: DATARETENV-POS-001
    signal: Efficient data lifecycle management
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear retention periods enforced
    - Storage tiering implemented
    - Automated lifecycle management
    - Growth rate controlled
