  what: |
    Evaluates whether user consent is truly informed - that users understand
    what they're agreeing to when they accept terms, permissions, or data
    processing. Assesses whether consent is specific, freely given, unambiguous,
    and based on clear information about consequences.

    Examines consent flows, disclosure adequacy, comprehension testing, and
    whether users can make genuinely informed decisions.
  why_it_matters: |
    Informed consent is foundational to ethical and legal data practices:

    - GDPR requires consent to be informed, specific, and freely given
    - Lack of informed consent invalidates consent under privacy law
    - Users who don't understand what they agreed to feel deceived
    - Informed consent is ethical foundation for data processing
    - Regulatory enforcement increasingly scrutinizes consent quality
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching consent flows
  - When collecting new data types
  - During GDPR/privacy compliance reviews
  - After user complaints about consent
prerequisites:
  required_artifacts:
  - type: consent_flows
    description: All consent collection interfaces
  - type: privacy_disclosures
    description: Privacy notices and disclosures
  access_requirements:
  - Access to consent interfaces
  - Privacy documentation
  - Interview access to privacy and legal teams
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Privacy/DPO
    questions:
    - How do you ensure consent is truly informed?
    - What information is provided before consent?
    - How is comprehension verified?
    - What makes consent 'freely given' in your assessment?
    purpose: Understand consent design philosophy
    duration: 45 min
  - role: UX Designer
    questions:
    - How were consent flows designed for comprehension?
    - What user testing was done on consent interfaces?
    - How do you balance legal requirements with usability?
    purpose: Understand design choices
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Privacy Notices
    purpose: Assess information provided
    look_for:
    - Clarity and readability
    - Specificity of data use descriptions
    - Consequences explained
  - type: Consent Flows
    purpose: Review consent collection
    look_for:
    - Information presented before consent
    - Consent granularity
    - Ability to decline

signals:
  critical:
  - id: INFORMED-CRIT-001
    signal: Consent collected without adequate disclosure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Consent checkbox without linked explanation
    - Data uses not described before consent
    - Consequences of consent not explained
    - Consent assumed without explicit action
    explanation: |
      Consent without adequate disclosure is not informed consent
      and is invalid under GDPR and similar regulations.
    remediation: |
      - Provide clear disclosure before consent request
      - Explain what data is collected and why
      - Describe consequences of consent
      - Require explicit consent action
  - id: INFORMED-CRIT-002
    signal: Bundled consent prevents granular choice
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single consent covers unrelated purposes
    - Cannot consent to some uses without others
    - Essential and optional purposes bundled
    - All-or-nothing consent
    explanation: |
      GDPR requires specific consent - bundling unrelated purposes
      prevents informed, specific consent.
    remediation: |
      - Unbundle consent by purpose
      - Allow granular consent choices
      - Separate essential from optional processing
  high:
  - id: INFORMED-HIGH-001
    signal: Disclosure language incomprehensible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reading level too high for audience
    - Legal jargon without plain language
    - Key concepts not explained
    - Information buried in length
    explanation: |
      If users cannot understand disclosures, consent is not informed.
      GDPR requires clear, plain language.
    remediation: |
      - Simplify disclosure language
      - Target appropriate reading level
      - Use plain language principles
      - Provide layered disclosure
  - id: INFORMED-HIGH-002
    signal: Consent not freely given
    evidence_indicators:
    - Service refused without consent to non-essential processing
    - Pressure or urgency in consent request
    - Consent as condition for unrelated benefit
    - Imbalance of power makes refusal impractical
    explanation: |
      GDPR requires consent be freely given - conditioning service
      on non-essential consent or applying pressure invalidates consent.
    remediation: |
      - Allow service use without non-essential consent
      - Remove pressure from consent requests
      - Don't condition benefits on unrelated consent
  medium:
  - id: INFORMED-MED-001
    signal: Consent flow lacks key information
    evidence_indicators:
    - Data retention not mentioned
    - Third-party sharing not disclosed
    - User rights not explained
    remediation: |
      - Include all required GDPR disclosures
      - Explain data retention clearly
      - Disclose third-party sharing
      - Inform users of their rights
  positive:
  - id: INFORMED-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive informed consent implementation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear disclosure before consent
    - Granular consent options
    - Plain language explanations
    - Freely given without pressure
