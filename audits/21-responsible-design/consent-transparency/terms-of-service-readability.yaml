  what: |
    Assesses whether Terms of Service, privacy policies, and other legal
    documents are readable and comprehensible to average users. Evaluates
    reading level, length, structure, use of plain language, and whether
    key terms are highlighted or summarized.

    Applies readability metrics (Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG) and qualitative
    assessment of comprehensibility.
  why_it_matters: |
    Unreadable legal documents undermine consent:

    - GDPR requires clear, plain language
    - Consumer protection laws require understandable terms
    - Users cannot meaningfully agree to incomprehensible terms
    - Overly complex terms may be unenforceable
    - Poor readability signals lack of user respect
  when_to_run:
  - When updating legal documents
  - During compliance reviews
  - When launching in new markets
  - Periodically to maintain standards

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TOSREAD-CRIT-001
    signal: Key user-adverse terms buried in document
    evidence_indicators:
    - Arbitration clauses without highlight
    - Liability waivers hidden in text
    - Data practices buried deep in document
    - Important terms not summarized
    explanation: |
      Burying important terms users would want to know prevents
      informed agreement and may be unenforceable.
    remediation: |
      - Highlight key user-affecting terms
      - Create summary of important provisions
      - Use visual emphasis for critical terms
      - Consider layered document approach
  high:
  - id: TOSREAD-HIGH-001
    signal: Reading level far exceeds audience
    evidence_indicators:
    - Flesch-Kincaid grade level >12
    - SMOG index >12
    - Consumer product with graduate-level terms
    - Target audience cannot reasonably understand
    explanation: |
      Terms requiring advanced education exclude most users from
      understanding. GDPR requires language appropriate for audience.
    remediation: |
      - Simplify language to 8th-10th grade level
      - Use plain language principles
      - Define technical terms
      - Test with representative users
  - id: TOSREAD-HIGH-002
    signal: Excessive length without organization
    evidence_indicators:
    - 10,000+ words without table of contents
    - No section headers or navigation
    - Key information not findable
    - Wall of text presentation
    explanation: |
      Excessive unorganized length ensures users won't read or
      find important information.
    remediation: |
      - Add clear section headers
      - Create table of contents
      - Provide navigation aids
      - Consider summary version
  medium:
  - id: TOSREAD-MED-001
    signal: Heavy use of legal jargon
    evidence_indicators:
    - Latin phrases without explanation
    - Legal terms of art undefined
    - Contract language in consumer context
    remediation: |
      - Define legal terms
      - Use plain language alternatives
      - Provide glossary if needed
  positive:
  - id: TOSREAD-POS-001
    signal: Readable, well-structured legal documents
    evidence_indicators:
    - Appropriate reading level
    - Clear organization
    - Summary of key terms
    - Plain language throughout
