description:
  what: |
    Assesses whether users have clear, accessible information about how
    their data is collected, used, shared, and retained. Evaluates transparency
    of data practices including what data is collected, for what purposes,
    with whom it's shared, and for how long it's kept.

    Examines privacy policies, in-product disclosures, data dashboards,
    and user-facing explanations of data practices.
  why_it_matters: |
    Transparency is a cornerstone of privacy regulation and ethics:

    - GDPR requires transparent processing and disclosure
    - CCPA requires disclosure of data practices
    - Users cannot exercise rights they don't know about
    - Lack of transparency damages trust
    - Regulatory enforcement targets opacity
  when_to_run:
  - When reviewing privacy documentation
  - Before launching new data collection
  - During privacy compliance reviews
  - After data practice changes
prerequisites:

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DATATRANS-CRIT-001
    signal: Data practices not disclosed to users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Data collected without disclosure
    - Uses not explained in privacy policy
    - Third-party sharing hidden
    - No accessible privacy information
    explanation: |
      Collecting or using data without disclosure violates transparency
      requirements under GDPR, CCPA, and ethical standards.
    remediation: |
      - Document all data practices
      - Disclose in privacy policy
      - Provide just-in-time notices
      - Make disclosures accessible
  - id: DATATRANS-CRIT-002
    signal: Privacy policy significantly misrepresents practices
    evidence_indicators:
    - Policy says 'don't sell' but data is sold
    - Practices exceed disclosed purposes
    - Material omissions about data use
    explanation: |
      Privacy policy misrepresentation is deceptive practice
      that can result in FTC enforcement and legal liability.
    remediation: |
      - Audit practices against policy
      - Update policy to match practices
      - Or change practices to match policy
  high:
  - id: DATATRANS-HIGH-001
    signal: Privacy policy incomprehensible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Excessive length without summary
    - Legal jargon throughout
    - Key information buried
    - Reading level inappropriate
    explanation: |
      If users cannot understand privacy policy, transparency is not
      achieved. GDPR requires clear, plain language.
    remediation: |
      - Create layered privacy notice
      - Add plain language summary
      - Simplify language
      - Use visual aids
  - id: DATATRANS-HIGH-002
    signal: No just-in-time disclosures
    evidence_indicators:
    - Data collected without contextual notice
    - Privacy policy only place for information
    - No explanation at collection points
    explanation: |
      Just-in-time disclosure provides context when users need it
      most. Relying only on privacy policy is insufficient.
    remediation: |
      - Add collection point notices
      - Explain purpose in context
      - Link to relevant policy sections
  medium:
  - id: DATATRANS-MED-001
    signal: Retention periods not clearly disclosed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Vague retention statements
    - No retention periods specified
    - '''As long as necessary'' without clarification'
    remediation: |
      - Specify retention periods
      - Explain retention criteria
      - Document in privacy policy
  positive:
  - id: DATATRANS-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive transparency implementation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear, layered privacy notices
    - Just-in-time disclosures
    - Data dashboard for users
    - Plain language explanations
