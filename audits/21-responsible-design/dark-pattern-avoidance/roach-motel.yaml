  what: |
    Evaluates whether it is as easy to cancel, unsubscribe, or delete
    an account as it was to sign up - the "roach motel" pattern makes
    it easy to get in but hard to get out. Examines cancellation flows,
    account deletion processes, unsubscribe mechanisms, and data deletion
    requests.

    Tests the FTC's "click-to-cancel" principle: if you can sign up
    online, you should be able to cancel online just as easily.
  why_it_matters: |
    Hard-to-cancel practices face increasing legal scrutiny:

    - FTC's click-to-cancel rule requires simple cancellation
    - California auto-renewal law requires easy cancellation
    - GDPR requires straightforward data deletion
    - Class actions over cancellation difficulty are common
    - FTC enforcement actions have resulted in significant penalties

    Beyond legal risk, making cancellation difficult creates angry
    customers who vocally complain and damage brand reputation.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching subscription or membership products
  - When modifying cancellation or account deletion flows
  - After cancellation-related complaints
  - Annually for all subscription products

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ROACH-CRIT-001
    signal: Cancellation requires different channel than signup
    evidence_indicators:
    - Online signup but phone/mail required to cancel
    - App signup but web-only cancellation
    - Self-service signup but support-required cancellation
    - Signup method not available for cancellation
    explanation: |
      FTC's click-to-cancel rule requires cancellation be available
      through the same mechanism as signup. Requiring different
      channels adds friction and may violate regulations.
    remediation: |
      - Enable cancellation through same channel as signup
      - If online signup, provide online cancellation
      - Remove channel restrictions on cancellation
      - Document all available cancellation methods
  - id: ROACH-CRIT-002
    signal: Cancellation significantly more difficult than signup
    evidence_indicators:
    - 'Signup: 2 clicks, Cancel: 10+ steps'
    - 'Signup: 1 minute, Cancel: 30+ minutes'
    - Mandatory waiting periods before cancellation
    - Multiple barriers not present in signup
    explanation: |
      Extreme asymmetry between signup and cancellation difficulty
      is a hallmark roach motel pattern that violates consumer
      protection principles and upcoming regulations.
    remediation: |
      - Simplify cancellation to match signup ease
      - Remove unnecessary steps from cancellation
      - Eliminate waiting periods
      - Apply "as easy to cancel as signup" standard
  - id: ROACH-CRIT-003
    signal: Account/data deletion not available or buried
    evidence_indicators:
    - No self-service account deletion
    - Deletion requires contacting support
    - Deletion option hidden in settings
    - GDPR deletion requests not honored promptly
    explanation: |
      GDPR and state privacy laws require accessible data deletion.
      Burying or complicating deletion violates these requirements
      and dark pattern regulations.
    remediation: |
      - Implement self-service account deletion
      - Place deletion option prominently in settings
      - Honor deletion requests within required timeframes
      - Provide deletion confirmation
  high:
  - id: ROACH-HIGH-001
    signal: Mandatory retention flow with multiple offers
    evidence_indicators:
    - Must decline 3+ retention offers to cancel
    - Each offer requires separate dismissal
    - Flow designed to exhaust user
    - Cannot skip retention offers
    explanation: |
      While a single retention offer may be acceptable, mandatory
      multi-step retention flows create undue friction and may
      constitute obstruction.
    remediation: |
      - Limit retention to 1-2 offers maximum
      - Allow immediate cancellation if requested
      - Make "skip" or "proceed" option prominent
      - Remove mandatory offer acceptance steps
  - id: ROACH-HIGH-002
    signal: Phone cancellation with intentional friction
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long hold times for cancellation
    - Limited hours for cancellation line
    - Agents trained to extend calls
    - Required 'save' attempts before processing
    explanation: |
      When phone is required for cancellation, making it difficult
      through long waits, limited hours, or aggressive retention
      compounds the roach motel problem.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce hold times for cancellation
      - Extend hours for cancellation service
      - Train agents to respect cancellation requests
      - Add self-service cancellation option
  - id: ROACH-HIGH-003
    signal: Cancellation requires mailing physical form
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cancellation requires printed form
    - Must be sent via specific mail service
    - Processing time adds to commitment
    - No electronic alternative provided
    explanation: |
      Requiring physical mail for cancellation when signup was
      electronic is a clear roach motel pattern that creates
      significant friction.
    remediation: |
      - Enable electronic cancellation
      - Match cancellation channel to signup
      - Remove physical mail requirements
      - Process electronic requests promptly
  medium:
  - id: ROACH-MED-001
    signal: Cancellation buried in settings
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple clicks through settings to find cancel
    - Misleading menu labels
    - Cancel not in expected location
    remediation: |
      - Place cancellation prominently in account settings
      - Use clear 'Cancel subscription' labeling
      - Match user mental models for location
  - id: ROACH-MED-002
    signal: Unsubscribe from emails difficult
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unsubscribe link tiny or hidden
    - Multiple steps to unsubscribe
    - Must log in to unsubscribe
    - Unsubscribe 'preferences' instead of full unsubscribe
    remediation: |
      - Provide clear, one-click unsubscribe
      - No login required for email unsubscribe
      - Include full unsubscribe option
      - Meet CAN-SPAM requirements
