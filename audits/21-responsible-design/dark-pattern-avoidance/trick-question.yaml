description:
  what: |
    Evaluates whether the product uses confusing or misleading questions
    to trick users into unintended choices. This includes double negatives,
    ambiguous opt-out/opt-in language, questions where 'yes' means different
    things in different contexts, or convoluted phrasing that makes the
    desired action unclear.

    Examines consent forms, settings interfaces, email preferences, and
    any user-facing questions that could be misinterpreted.
  why_it_matters: |
    Trick questions undermine informed consent:

    - Users make choices opposite to their intent
    - GDPR requires clear, plain language for consent
    - Creates user frustration when error is discovered
    - May constitute deceptive practice under consumer protection law
    - Damages trust when users realize manipulation

    Questions designed to confuse are particularly harmful as users
    believe they're making informed choices.
  when_to_run:
  - During UX copy review
  - When designing consent or preference forms
  - After user feedback about confusing interfaces
  - During accessibility reviews
prerequisites:
  required_artifacts:
  - type: ui_copy
    description: All question/option text in product
  - type: consent_forms
    description: Consent and preference interfaces
  access_requirements:
  - Access to product interfaces
  - Access to UX copy documentation
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: UX Writer
    questions:
    - What guidelines exist for writing questions and options?
    - How do you test for comprehension?
    - Have there been reports of user confusion?
    - How are consent questions reviewed?
    purpose: Understand copy practices
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Consent Forms
    purpose: Review question clarity
    look_for:
    - Double negatives
    - Ambiguous phrasing
    - Inconsistent yes/no meaning
    - Convoluted language
  - type: Settings Interfaces
    purpose: Review option language
    look_for:
    - Toggle labels that confuse
    - Checkbox text that misleads
    - Options with unclear outcomes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TRICK-CRIT-001
    signal: Double negative makes intended choice unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Check to not receive'' or ''Uncheck to disable'''
    - '''Don''t unsubscribe'' type constructions'
    - Negatives that reverse expected meaning
    - Users frequently make opposite choice
    explanation: |
      Double negatives require mental processing that leads to errors.
      This violates plain language requirements and can result in users
      making choices opposite to their intent.
    remediation: |
      - Use positive, direct language
      - 'Check to receive' not 'Check to not stop receiving'
      - Test with users for comprehension
      - Apply plain language guidelines
  - id: TRICK-CRIT-002
    signal: Yes/No meaning varies across similar questions
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Yes'' means opt-in on one question, opt-out on another'
    - Inconsistent question framing in same form
    - Users cannot predict what their answer will do
    explanation: |
      When the same response (yes/no) has different effects in similar
      contexts, users apply patterns that lead to wrong choices. This
      is particularly manipulative when strategic.
    remediation: |
      - Ensure consistent yes/no meaning
      - Same answer should have same directional effect
      - Review forms for consistency
      - Use action-oriented language instead of yes/no
  high:
  - id: TRICK-HIGH-001
    signal: Convoluted language obscures meaning
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multi-clause questions
    - Legalistic phrasing requiring parsing
    - Reading level exceeds audience
    - Users report not understanding
    explanation: |
      Complex language prevents comprehension, meaning users cannot
      make informed choices. GDPR specifically requires plain language.
    remediation: |
      - Simplify question language
      - Use short, direct sentences
      - Target appropriate reading level
      - Test comprehension with users
  - id: TRICK-HIGH-002
    signal: Question framing biases toward preferred answer
    evidence_indicators:
    - Leading questions
    - Questions that assume answer
    - Framing that makes one choice seem obvious
    - Emotional language in questions
    explanation: |
      Leading questions manipulate responses by making one answer
      seem more appropriate, preventing genuine choice.
    remediation: |
      - Use neutral question framing
      - Remove emotional or leading language
      - Present options without bias
      - Test for neutrality
  medium:
  - id: TRICK-MED-001
    signal: Toggle labels don't clearly indicate on/off state
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unclear which position is 'on'
    - Label could describe either state
    - No visual confirmation of current state
    remediation: |
      - Use clear on/off labels or descriptions
      - Show current state explicitly
      - Follow platform conventions
  - id: TRICK-MED-002
    signal: Checkbox bundles unrelated permissions
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single checkbox covers multiple permissions
    - Must accept all or none
    - Unrelated items grouped
    remediation: |
      - Unbundle unrelated permissions
      - One checkbox per distinct choice
      - Meet GDPR granular consent requirements
  positive:
  - id: TRICK-POS-001
    signal: Plain, clear question language
    evidence_indicators:
    - Simple, direct questions
    - Consistent yes/no meaning
    - No double negatives
  - id: TRICK-POS-002
    signal: User comprehension tested
    evidence_indicators:
    - Usability testing on questions
    - Comprehension metrics tracked
    - Iteration based on confusion
