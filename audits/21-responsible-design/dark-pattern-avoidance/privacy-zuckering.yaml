description:
  what: |
    Evaluates whether the product manipulates users into sharing more
    personal data than intended through confusing interfaces, defaults
    that maximize data collection, or unclear privacy settings. Named
    after Facebook's historical privacy practices, this pattern tricks
    users into revealing information they would prefer to keep private.

    Examines privacy settings complexity, default configurations,
    consent flows, and data sharing disclosures.
  why_it_matters: |
    Privacy zuckering has severe regulatory and trust implications:

    - GDPR requires privacy by design and by default
    - Data minimization principle requires limiting collection
    - Consent must be informed, specific, and freely given
    - FTC has taken action against deceptive privacy practices
    - EU DSA prohibits dark patterns in consent interfaces

    Beyond regulation, users who discover their data was collected
    through manipulation lose trust and may become vocal critics.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching privacy controls or consent flows
  - When modifying data collection defaults
  - After privacy complaints or incidents
  - During GDPR/privacy compliance reviews
  - Annually for all user-facing products

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ZUCKERING-CRIT-001
    signal: Privacy-invasive defaults without clear disclosure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Data sharing enabled by default
    - Maximum tracking enabled by default
    - Permissions granted without explicit consent
    - New users unaware of data collection scope
    explanation: |
      GDPR requires privacy by default - the most privacy-protective
      settings should be default. Maximally invasive defaults without
      clear disclosure violate this principle and may constitute
      deceptive practice.
    remediation: |
      - Set privacy-protective defaults
      - Require opt-in for non-essential data collection
      - Clearly disclose default settings at signup
      - Apply data minimization principle
  - id: ZUCKERING-CRIT-002
    signal: Consent interface designed to maximize acceptance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Accept button prominent, reject hidden
    - Reject requires more clicks than accept
    - '''Accept all'' prominent, granular options buried'
    - Cookie consent that makes rejection difficult
    explanation: |
      When consent interfaces are designed to manipulate users into
      accepting data collection, consent is not freely given under
      GDPR. This constitutes both a dark pattern and legal violation.
    remediation: |
      - Make accept and reject equally prominent
      - Provide single-click reject option
      - Make granular choices accessible
      - Remove consent manipulation
  - id: ZUCKERING-CRIT-003
    signal: Privacy settings deliberately confusing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple layers of settings to navigate
    - Contradictory or unclear option language
    - Settings that don't do what they appear to do
    - Privacy options scattered across multiple locations
    explanation: |
      Deliberately confusing privacy settings prevent users from
      exercising control over their data, violating the spirit of
      privacy regulations and constituting a dark pattern.
    remediation: |
      - Consolidate privacy settings in one location
      - Use clear, unambiguous language
      - Ensure settings do what they say
      - Simplify settings interface
  high:
  - id: ZUCKERING-HIGH-001
    signal: Permission requests exceed service requirements
    evidence_indicators:
    - Requesting permissions not needed for core function
    - Bulk permission requests rather than contextual
    - No explanation of why permission needed
    - Cannot use service without excessive permissions
    explanation: |
      Requesting more permissions than needed violates data minimization
      and may indicate data collection beyond user expectations.
    remediation: |
      - Limit permissions to functional necessity
      - Request permissions contextually when needed
      - Explain why each permission is needed
      - Allow service use without non-essential permissions
  - id: ZUCKERING-HIGH-002
    signal: Dark patterns in privacy preference changes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Turning off tracking requires many steps
    - Warnings when enabling privacy protection
    - Confirmshaming about privacy choices
    - Friction added to privacy-protective choices
    explanation: |
      Adding friction to privacy-protective choices while making
      privacy-invasive choices easy manipulates users toward
      less privacy.
    remediation: |
      - Make privacy-protective choices equally easy
      - Remove warnings about enabling privacy
      - Stop confirmshaming privacy choices
      - Apply symmetric ease to all choices
  - id: ZUCKERING-HIGH-003
    signal: Confusing language about data use
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Personalization'' meaning advertising'
    - '''Improve your experience'' meaning data collection'
    - Euphemisms obscuring actual data practices
    - Technical language preventing understanding
    explanation: |
      Using confusing or euphemistic language about data practices
      prevents informed consent and may constitute deceptive practice.
    remediation: |
      - Use plain language about data practices
      - Call advertising 'advertising' not 'personalization'
      - Explain actual data use clearly
      - Avoid misleading euphemisms
  medium:
  - id: ZUCKERING-MED-001
    signal: Privacy settings not discoverable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Privacy settings buried in menus
    - No clear path to privacy controls
    - Must know specific location to find settings
    remediation: |
      - Make privacy settings easily findable
      - Include in main settings navigation
      - Link from privacy policy
  - id: ZUCKERING-MED-002
    signal: Insufficient granularity in privacy choices
    evidence_indicators:
    - All-or-nothing consent
    - Cannot choose specific data types
    - Bundle consent for unrelated purposes
    remediation: |
      - Provide granular consent options
      - Separate consent by purpose
      - Allow selective data sharing
  positive:
  - id: ZUCKERING-POS-001

    - Data sharing opt-in only
    - Tracking disabled by default
  - id: ZUCKERING-POS-002
    signal: Clear, accessible privacy controls
    evidence_indicators:
    - Privacy settings in obvious location
