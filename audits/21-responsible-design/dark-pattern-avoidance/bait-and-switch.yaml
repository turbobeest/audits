  what: |
    Evaluates whether the product employs bait-and-switch tactics -
    advertising or presenting one thing to attract users, then substituting
    something different once they're engaged. This includes feature changes
    after signup, pricing changes after commitment, or actions that produce
    unexpected results.

    Examines marketing promises versus delivered experience, UI actions
    that do something different than expected, and post-signup changes.
  why_it_matters: |
    Bait and switch is a recognized deceptive practice:

    - FTC Act Section 5 prohibits deceptive practices
    - Bait advertising is specifically regulated
    - Can constitute fraud in severe cases
    - Damages trust and increases churn
    - Creates negative word-of-mouth and reviews

    Digital products have new bait-and-switch vectors including
    click hijacking, where clicks do something different than indicated.
  when_to_run:
  - When reviewing marketing claims
  - When auditing UI action outcomes
  - After complaints about misleading features
  - Before major product or pricing changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: BAIT-CRIT-001
    signal: UI actions produce different result than indicated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Close button opens something else
    - Cancel button has side effects
    - Download button starts something else
    - Actions hijacked to different outcomes
    explanation: |
      When UI elements do something different than their label indicates,
      users are deceived about what their action will do. This is a
      severe violation of user trust and potentially illegal.
    remediation: |
      - Ensure all UI elements do what they indicate
      - Audit for click hijacking patterns
      - Remove deceptive UI actions
      - Follow platform UI conventions
  - id: BAIT-CRIT-002
    signal: Advertised price not available
    evidence_indicators:
    - Displayed price requires specific conditions
    - Advertised price only for limited time
    - Price increases after commitment
    - Bait pricing to draw users then switch
    explanation: |
      Bait pricing that draws users then substitutes higher price
      is classic deceptive advertising prohibited by FTC regulations.
    remediation: |
      - Display honest, achievable pricing
      - Clearly disclose conditions for advertised price
      - Honor advertised prices
      - Avoid misleading promotional pricing
  - id: BAIT-CRIT-003
    signal: Advertised features not delivered
    evidence_indicators:
    - Features shown in marketing not in product
    - Features removed after launch/signup
    - Core advertised capability not available
    - Marketing shows capabilities product lacks
    explanation: |
      Marketing features that don't exist or are removed is deceptive
      practice. Users who signed up expecting features were deceived.
    remediation: |
      - Align marketing with actual product capabilities
      - Remove marketing for unavailable features
      - Honor feature commitments
      - Communicate changes transparently
  high:
  - id: BAIT-HIGH-001
    signal: Free tier significantly different from marketing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Marketing implies capabilities not in free tier
    - Free tier unusably limited despite marketing
    - Key features require upgrade despite 'free' marketing
    explanation: |
      Marketing a product as free when meaningful use requires payment
      is deceptive. Users invest time based on false expectation.
    remediation: |
      - Clearly communicate free tier limitations in marketing
      - Ensure free tier provides meaningful value
      - Don't market features unavailable on free tier
  - id: BAIT-HIGH-002
    signal: Terms change after signup without notice
    evidence_indicators:
    - Pricing increased for existing users
    - Features removed without notice
    - Terms changed unilaterally
    - No opt-out for changed terms
    explanation: |
      Changing terms after signup without adequate notice or option
      to exit at original terms is a form of bait and switch.
    remediation: |
      - Provide advance notice of changes
      - Honor original terms for reasonable period
      - Allow opt-out when terms change
      - Communicate changes clearly
  medium:
