  what: |
    Evaluates whether the product uses forced continuity dark patterns -
    automatically enrolling users in paid subscriptions after free trials
    without clear disclosure, making it difficult to cancel, or silently
    renewing subscriptions without adequate notice.

    Examines free trial to paid conversion flows, subscription renewal
    processes, cancellation pathways, and billing transparency.
  why_it_matters: |
    Forced continuity is one of the most costly dark patterns for consumers:

    - FTC enforcement actions have resulted in significant penalties
    - ROSCA (Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act) specifically addresses this
    - EU Digital Services Act prohibits manipulative subscription practices
    - California and other states have auto-renewal disclosure laws
    - Class action lawsuits over forced continuity are common

    Beyond legal risk, forced continuity damages customer trust and creates
    negative brand perception when customers feel trapped or deceived.

      Step-by-step walkthrough documenting:

      - Notifications before conversion
      - Ease of cancellation
      - Retention tactics encountered
    offline_capable: true

    offline_capable: true
signals:
  critical:
  - id: FORCEDCONT-CRIT-001
    signal: No clear disclosure of automatic billing before trial signup
    evidence_indicators:
    - Trial signup doesn't clearly state conversion to paid
    - Billing amount not displayed at signup
    - Automatic renewal not mentioned prominently
    - Terms buried in fine print or separate page
    explanation: |
      ROSCA and state laws require clear and conspicuous disclosure of
      automatic billing before obtaining billing information. Failure
      to disclose creates legal liability and consumer harm.
    remediation: |
      - Add clear, prominent disclosure at signup
      - Display billing amount and timing
      - Use plain language for auto-renewal terms
      - Require affirmative consent with clear terms
  - id: FORCEDCONT-CRIT-002
    signal: No notification before automatic charge
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users not notified before trial converts to paid
    - Renewal notices not sent before annual renewal
    - Notifications sent but not prominent (buried in marketing)
    - Insufficient notice period
    explanation: |
      Many jurisdictions require advance notice before automatic charges.
      California requires 3-45 days before annual renewal. Failure to
      notify creates legal liability and customer disputes.
    remediation: |
      - Implement pre-charge notification system
      - Send clear, dedicated billing notices
      - Provide adequate notice period per jurisdiction
      - Include easy cancellation instructions in notices
  - id: FORCEDCONT-CRIT-003
    signal: Cancellation requires phone call when signup was online
    evidence_indicators:
    - Online signup but cancellation requires calling
    - Phone line difficult to reach or limited hours
    - Long hold times for cancellation
    - No online cancellation option
    explanation: |
      FTC's click-to-cancel rule and various state laws require that
      cancellation be as easy as signup. Forcing phone cancellation
      for online signup violates these requirements.
    remediation: |
      - Implement online cancellation matching signup method
      - If phone required, make it accessible and easy
      - Consider FTC click-to-cancel requirements
      - Document cancellation method in terms
  high:
  - id: FORCEDCONT-HIGH-001
    signal: Multiple retention screens before cancellation completes
    evidence_indicators:
    - More than 2 screens between cancel click and confirmation
    - Aggressive retention offers interrupting flow
    - Countdown timers or urgency tactics during cancellation
    - Must decline multiple offers to proceed
    explanation: |
      While retention efforts are allowed, excessive friction in
      cancellation can constitute a dark pattern and violate
      regulations requiring easy cancellation.
    remediation: |
      - Limit retention to 1-2 screens maximum
      - Make decline option equally prominent
      - Allow immediate cancellation if user declines offers
      - Avoid urgency tactics during cancellation
  - id: FORCEDCONT-HIGH-002
    signal: Cancellation buried or difficult to find
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cancel option not in account settings
    - Multiple clicks through nested menus to find
    - Misleading labels (e.g., 'modify plan' vs 'cancel')
    - Required to contact support to locate
    explanation: |
      Hiding cancellation options is a recognized dark pattern that
      frustrates users and may violate consumer protection laws
      requiring accessible cancellation.
    remediation: |
      - Place cancellation prominently in account settings
      - Use clear labeling ('Cancel subscription')
      - Provide cancellation instructions in welcome emails
      - Consider dedicated 'Manage subscription' section
  medium:
  - id: FORCEDCONT-MED-001
    signal: Confirmshaming in cancellation flow
    evidence_indicators:
    - Guilt-inducing language ('You'll lose all your progress')
    - Emotional manipulation ('We'll miss you')
    - Misleading loss framing ('Don't lose your discount')
    - Asymmetric button prominence
    remediation: |
      - Use neutral, factual language
      - Make keep/cancel buttons equally prominent
      - Focus on factual consequences, not emotional manipulation
      - Review against confirmshaming patterns
  - id: FORCEDCONT-MED-002
    signal: Unclear billing terms at signup
    evidence_indicators:
    - Price shown without billing frequency
    - Renewal terms in separate terms page
    - Ambiguous 'free trial' language
    remediation: |
      - Display price, frequency, and renewal terms together
      - Use clear, specific language ('$9.99/month, renews automatically')
      - Highlight trial end date prominently
  positive:
  - id: FORCEDCONT-POS-001
    signal: Clear, prominent disclosure and easy cancellation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Billing terms clear at signup
    - Pre-charge notifications sent
    - Cancellation accessible and simple
    - One-click or simple flow to cancel
  - id: FORCEDCONT-POS-002
