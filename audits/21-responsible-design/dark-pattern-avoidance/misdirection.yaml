description:
  what: |
    Evaluates whether the product uses misdirection dark patterns -
    design techniques that focus user attention on one thing to distract
    from another, typically to encourage upgrades, prevent cancellation,
    or obscure important information.

    Examines visual hierarchy, attention manipulation, decoy options,
    and asymmetric emphasis between user-beneficial and business-beneficial
    choices.
  why_it_matters: |
    Misdirection manipulates user attention to achieve business goals at
    user expense:

    - EU DSA prohibits design that subverts user decision-making
    - Creates user frustration when manipulation is noticed
    - Undermines trust and informed consent
    - Can constitute unfair practice under consumer protection laws
    - Often combined with other dark patterns for compounding effect
  when_to_run:
  - During UX design reviews
  - When designing pricing or upgrade flows
  - When creating consent or settings interfaces
  - After user complaints about confusing interfaces

discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: UX Designer
    questions:
    - How do you prioritize visual emphasis in the design?
    - What A/B tests have been run on button prominence?
    - Have there been discussions about 'highlighting' preferred options?
    - How do you balance business and user goals in design?
    purpose: Understand design intent and practices
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Product Manager
    questions:
    - What conversion goals drive the design of key flows?
    - How is visual design used to achieve business metrics?
    - What feedback have users given about confusing interfaces?
    purpose: Understand business pressures on design

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MISDIR-CRIT-001
    signal: User-adverse option obscured or hidden
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cancel or decline button hidden below fold
    - User-beneficial option requires scrolling to find
    - Important option in tiny/hard-to-read text
    - Option placement designed to be missed
    explanation: |
      Hiding options that users would want to see (cancel, decline, free
      version) while emphasizing business-preferred options is manipulation
      that subverts informed choice.
    remediation: |
      - Ensure all options equally visible
      - Place user-beneficial options prominently
      - Use consistent, readable sizing for all options
      - Apply equal visual weight to alternatives
  - id: MISDIR-CRIT-002
    signal: Extreme visual asymmetry between options
    evidence_indicators:
    - Large colorful 'Accept' vs. tiny gray 'Decline'
    - Primary button styling only on business-preferred option
    - '>3x size difference between alternatives'
    - User-beneficial option styled as disabled
    explanation: |
      When visual design creates extreme asymmetry between options,
      users are manipulated toward the emphasized option regardless
      of their true preference. This subverts autonomous choice.
    remediation: |
      - Apply similar styling to all options
      - Size alternatives comparably
      - Use consistent button styling
      - Consider user goals in visual hierarchy
  high:
  - id: MISDIR-HIGH-001
    signal: Decoy option designed to make expensive option seem reasonable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Three-tier pricing with middle tier clearly best value
    - Expensive option exists mainly to anchor perception
    - Pricing structured to manipulate toward target tier
    - No customers expected to choose decoy
    explanation: |
      While pricing strategy is legitimate, decoy pricing designed purely
      to manipulate perception rather than serve customer segments may
      be manipulative, especially when deceptive about value.
    remediation: |
      - Ensure all options serve genuine customer segments
      - Provide honest value comparison
      - Avoid purely psychological anchoring
      - Let customers make informed choices
  - id: MISDIR-HIGH-002
    signal: Attention distracted from important disclosure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Prominent visuals distract from terms
    - Animation or motion draws attention away from disclosures
    - Important information in easily-overlooked location
    - Design deliberately fragments attention
    explanation: |
      Using visual design to distract from important information
      (terms, fees, commitments) undermines informed consent and
      may constitute deceptive practice.
    remediation: |
      - Ensure important information is attention-prominent
      - Avoid competing visual elements near disclosures
      - Design for comprehension, not distraction
      - Test that users notice key information
  medium:
  - id: MISDIR-MED-001
    signal: Default selection favors business over user
    evidence_indicators:
    - More expensive option pre-selected
    - Data-sharing options defaulted to maximum
    - Default would not be user's likely choice
    remediation: |
      - Consider user-beneficial defaults
      - Avoid pre-selecting expensive options
      - Meet regulatory requirements for defaults (e.g., GDPR)
  - id: MISDIR-MED-002
    signal: Confusing information architecture
    evidence_indicators:
    - Settings organized to obscure privacy options
    - Beneficial features harder to find than premium upsells
    - Navigation designed for business goals over user tasks
    remediation: |
      - Organize information by user needs
      - Make privacy settings accessible
      - Align navigation with user mental models
  positive:
  - id: MISDIR-POS-001
    signal: Equal visual treatment of all options
    evidence_indicators:
    - Accept/Decline similarly styled
    - All pricing tiers fairly presented
    - User-beneficial options easy to find
  - id: MISDIR-POS-002
    signal: Design optimizes for user comprehension
    evidence_indicators:
    - Important information prominently displayed
    - Visual hierarchy serves user understanding
    - Options clearly differentiated by genuine value
