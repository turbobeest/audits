  what: |
    Evaluates whether the product uses confirmshaming - language that
    guilts or shames users into choosing the business-preferred option.
    This includes opt-out text like "No, I don't want to save money" or
    "No thanks, I'll pay full price" designed to emotionally manipulate
    users.

    Examines popup dismissals, newsletter opt-outs, upgrade declines,
    cancellation flows, and any choice language for manipulative framing.
  why_it_matters: |
    Confirmshaming is emotionally manipulative:

    - Exploits social psychology to override user preferences
    - Creates negative emotional experience
    - Undermines autonomous decision-making
    - Increasing regulatory attention as manipulative design
    - Damages brand perception when users notice manipulation

    While it may boost short-term conversions, it erodes trust and
    creates resentment that affects long-term customer relationships.
  when_to_run:
  - During UX copy review
  - When designing modals, popups, or prompts
  - When reviewing cancellation or opt-out flows
  - After feedback about manipulative language

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CONFIRM-CRIT-001
    signal: Decline options use self-deprecating or shaming language
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''No, I don''t like saving money'''
    - '''No thanks, I prefer to struggle'''
    - Decline implies user is foolish or irrational
    - First-person negative statements
    explanation: |
      Forcing users to 'say' self-deprecating statements to decline
      is emotional manipulation that exploits cognitive consistency
      bias. This is a widely-recognized dark pattern.
    remediation: |
      - Use neutral decline language ('No thanks', 'Maybe later')
      - Avoid first-person negative statements
      - Respect user autonomy in decline wording
      - Apply consistent neutral tone across options
  - id: CONFIRM-CRIT-002
    signal: Emotional manipulation in opt-out language
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''We''ll miss you'' with sad imagery'
    - Guilt-inducing cancellation language
    - Fear-based decline framing
    - Language designed to trigger emotional response
    explanation: |
      Using emotional manipulation (guilt, fear, sadness) to influence
      decisions undermines rational choice and constitutes psychological
      manipulation.
    remediation: |
      - Use factual, neutral language
      - Avoid emotional imagery or language
      - Focus on information, not emotion
      - Respect user decisions without manipulation
  high:
  - id: CONFIRM-HIGH-001
    signal: Accept and decline asymmetric in emotional valence
    evidence_indicators:
    - 'Accept: ''Yes, I want awesome benefits!'''
    - 'Decline: ''No, I don''t care about security'''
    - Positive framing for accept, negative for decline
    - Emotional asymmetry in option text
    explanation: |
      When accept options are positively framed and decline options
      negatively framed, users are emotionally pressured toward
      accepting regardless of actual preference.
    remediation: |
      - Balance emotional valence of options
      - Use neutral framing for both choices
      - Focus on factual description of outcomes
  - id: CONFIRM-HIGH-002
    signal: Loss framing emphasizes what user will lose by declining
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''You''ll lose your progress'''
    - '''Don''t miss out on these benefits'''
    - Decline framed as giving up something
    - Emphasis on negative consequences of decline
    explanation: |
      Loss aversion framing manipulates by emphasizing what users
      lose rather than fairly presenting the choice. While factual
      information is fine, emphasis designed to trigger loss aversion
      is manipulative.
    remediation: |
      - Present choices neutrally
      - Avoid emphasizing losses over gains
      - Provide balanced information about both options
      - Let users evaluate tradeoffs independently
  medium:
  - id: CONFIRM-MED-001
    signal: Subtle guilt in decline language
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Maybe later'' vs ''Not interested'' options'
    - Decline implies user might change mind
    - Soft guilt without explicit shaming
    remediation: |
      - Provide clear 'No' or 'No thanks' options
      - Avoid implying user should reconsider
      - Respect finality of user decisions
  - id: CONFIRM-MED-002
    signal: Personification creating emotional connection
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Our team worked hard on this'''
    - Personal appeals from the team
    - Humanizing business to create guilt
    remediation: |
      - Minimize personal emotional appeals
      - Focus on product value, not team effort
      - Respect user's right to decline without guilt
  positive:
  - id: CONFIRM-POS-001
    signal: Neutral, respectful option language
    evidence_indicators:
    - Simple 'Yes' / 'No thanks' options
    - Factual description of choices
    - Equal respect for both options
  - id: CONFIRM-POS-002
    signal: User-centered copy practices
    evidence_indicators:
    - Copy guidelines prohibit confirmshaming
    - Review process catches manipulative language
    - User feedback shapes copy decisions
