  what: |
    Evaluates whether essential services or products have pricing models
    that enable access across economic levels. Assesses whether pricing
    creates barriers to essential services, whether accessibility options
    exist (tiered pricing, discounts, subsidized access), and whether
    pricing decisions consider economic equity.

    Examines pricing barriers, accessibility programs, and the balance
    between business sustainability and inclusive access.
  why_it_matters: |
    Pricing affects who can access products and services:

    - Essential services should be accessible across income levels
    - Pricing can perpetuate or reduce economic inequality
    - Accessibility pricing can expand market and mission impact
    - Some services have public interest obligations
    - Ethical business considers access alongside profit
    - Inaccessible pricing for essentials causes societal harm
  when_to_run:
  - For essential services or products
  - When serving diverse economic populations
  - During pricing strategy reviews
  - For mission-driven organizations

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ACCPRICE-CRIT-001
    signal: Essential service inaccessible to intended users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Pricing excludes significant portion of target users
    - No accessibility options for essential service
    - Price barrier prevents access to critical functionality
    - Lower-income users cannot afford necessary service
    explanation: |
      When essential services are priced beyond the reach of intended
      users, the service fails its purpose and may cause harm by
      excluding those who need it most.
    remediation: |
      - Develop tiered pricing structure
      - Create subsidized access programs
      - Consider free tier for essential features
      - Partner with subsidy providers
  high:
  - id: ACCPRICE-HIGH-001
    signal: No consideration of economic diversity
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single price point for all users
    - Price set for highest-income users
    - No discount or scholarship options
    - Economic accessibility not discussed
    explanation: |
      Without considering economic diversity, pricing may
      inadvertently exclude lower-income users from access.
    remediation: |
      - Analyze user economic diversity
      - Develop accessibility options
      - Consider income-based pricing
      - Create scholarship programs
  - id: ACCPRICE-HIGH-002
    signal: Accessibility programs hidden or difficult
    evidence_indicators:
    - Discount programs not advertised
    - Complex eligibility requirements
    - Demeaning application process
    - Low program awareness
    explanation: |
      Even when accessibility programs exist, barriers to using
      them can render them ineffective.
    remediation: |
      - Promote accessibility programs
      - Simplify eligibility process
      - Reduce stigma in application
      - Measure program uptake
  medium:
  - id: ACCPRICE-MED-001
    signal: Price increases without accessibility impact assessment
    evidence_indicators:

      - Include access impact in price decisions
      - Monitor affordability metrics
      - Adjust accessibility programs with prices
