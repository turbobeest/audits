description:
  what: |
    Evaluates whether products or services create artificial barriers to
    switching that trap users or businesses. Assesses whether lock-in is
    achieved through proprietary formats, data non-portability, artificial
    technical barriers, or contractual restrictions rather than genuine
    product value.

    Examines data portability, export capabilities, interoperability,
    contract terms, and switching costs relative to legitimate product value.
  why_it_matters: |
    Artificial lock-in raises ethical and legal concerns:

    - Trapping customers is fundamentally adversarial
    - GDPR requires data portability
    - Artificial barriers harm consumer choice
    - Lock-in can enable exploitative pricing once trapped
    - Interoperability regulations increasing (EU DMA)
    - Ethical products compete on value, not barriers
  when_to_run:
  - During product strategy review
  - For regulatory compliance (GDPR, DMA)
  - When evaluating competitive practices
  - Before major product decisions

    description: Interoperability and format documentation
  access_requirements:
  - Product documentation
  - Export capability review
  - Interview access to product team
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Product Lead
    questions:
    - Can users export all their data?
    - Are formats proprietary or standard?
    - What prevents users from switching?
    - Is lock-in part of the business model?
    - What interoperability exists?
    purpose: Understand portability and lock-in
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Engineering Lead
    questions:
    - Are there technical barriers to data export?
    - Could formats be more standard?
    - What would make interoperability easier?
    purpose: Understand technical barriers
    duration: 20 min

    - Format standards
    - Export ease
    - Frequency limits
  - type: Contract Terms
    purpose: Review contractual lock-in
    look_for:
    - Exit restrictions
    - Data retention on exit
    - Termination penalties

signals:
  critical:
  - id: LOCKIN-CRIT-001
    signal: User data not exportable
    evidence_indicators:
    - No data export capability
    - GDPR portability not implemented
    - Users cannot retrieve their data
    - Data held hostage on exit
    explanation: |
      Failing to provide data export violates GDPR and traps users
      by holding their data hostage. This is both illegal and unethical.
    remediation: |
      - Implement data export
      - Ensure GDPR portability compliance
      - Provide complete data download
      - Use portable formats
  - id: LOCKIN-CRIT-002
    signal: Artificial technical barriers to switching
    evidence_indicators:
    - Proprietary formats with no export
    - Deliberate incompatibility
    - Technical barriers without product justification
    - API restrictions to prevent integration
    explanation: |
      Artificial technical barriers that serve only to trap users
      are adversarial and may violate competition law.
    remediation: |
      - Review barriers for legitimacy
      - Implement standard formats where possible
      - Remove artificial restrictions
      - Enable interoperability
  high:
  - id: LOCKIN-HIGH-001
    signal: Data export incomplete or degraded
    evidence_indicators:
    - Export missing significant data
    - Export in unusable format
    - Historical data not included
    - Export quality lower than stored
    explanation: |
      Incomplete or degraded export is a form of lock-in that
      prevents effective switching even when export exists.
    remediation: |
      - Ensure complete data export
      - Use standard, usable formats
      - Include all historical data
      - Maintain data quality in export
  - id: LOCKIN-HIGH-002
    signal: Contractual lock-in without justification
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long mandatory contract terms
    - Excessive exit penalties
    - Data deletion on exit
    - Post-exit restrictions on data use
    explanation: |
      Contractual terms that trap users beyond reasonable business
      justification are adversarial to customers.
    remediation: |
      - Review contract terms for fairness
      - Allow data retention on exit
      - Remove excessive penalties
      - Justify any lock-in terms
  medium:
  - id: LOCKIN-MED-001
    signal: Export difficult or hidden
    evidence_indicators:
    - Export buried in settings
    - Complex export process
    - Rate limits on export
    - Export not documented
    remediation: |
      - Make export easily accessible
      - Simplify export process
      - Document export clearly
      - Remove unreasonable limits
  positive:
  - id: LOCKIN-POS-001
    signal: Ethical approach to customer retention
    evidence_indicators:
    - Complete, easy data export
    - Standard, portable formats
    - Interoperability enabled
    - Fair contract terms
    - Competition on value, not barriers
