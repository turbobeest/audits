description:
  what: |
    Evaluates pricing practices for predatory or exploitative patterns that
    harm consumers or competitors. Assesses whether pricing takes advantage
    of vulnerable populations, uses below-cost pricing to eliminate competition,
    employs price gouging during emergencies, or exploits information asymmetry
    to extract excessive value.

    Examines pricing logic, vulnerability targeting, competitive impact, and
    ethical pricing guardrails.
  why_it_matters: |
    Predatory pricing causes significant economic harm:

    - Targeting vulnerable populations is both unethical and often illegal
    - Below-cost predatory pricing damages market competition
    - Price gouging during emergencies harms those in crisis
    - FTC and state laws prohibit various predatory pricing practices
    - Reputational damage from predatory pricing exposure
    - Long-term harm to consumer trust and market health
  when_to_run:
  - During pricing strategy review
  - When serving vulnerable populations
  - For antitrust compliance
  - When price complaints arise

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PREDPRICE-CRIT-001
    signal: Targeting vulnerable populations for higher prices
    evidence_indicators:
    - Higher prices to lower-income areas
    - Exploiting urgent need for higher pricing
    - Targeting elderly or less tech-savvy for worse deals
    - Using desperation to extract higher prices
    explanation: |
      Targeting vulnerable populations for higher prices is both
      unethical and often illegal, causing direct economic harm
      to those least able to bear it.
    remediation: |
      - Audit pricing by demographic/geography
      - Implement fair pricing policies
      - Remove vulnerability-based pricing
      - Consider assistance programs
  - id: PREDPRICE-CRIT-002
    signal: Price gouging during emergencies
    evidence_indicators:
    - Significant price increases during disasters
    - Surge pricing during emergencies
    - Exploiting supply shortages
    - No price caps during crisis
    explanation: |
      Price gouging during emergencies is illegal in many jurisdictions
      and causes severe harm when people are most vulnerable.
    remediation: |
      - Implement emergency price caps
      - Create anti-gouging policies
      - Monitor for price spikes during events
      - Ensure compliance with state laws
  high:
  - id: PREDPRICE-HIGH-001
    signal: Below-cost pricing to eliminate competitors
    evidence_indicators:
    - Sustained pricing below cost
    - Pricing targets competitor elimination
    - Cross-subsidization for predatory effect
    - Intent to raise prices after competition eliminated
    explanation: |
      Below-cost predatory pricing can violate antitrust laws and
      ultimately harms consumers by eliminating competition.
    remediation: |
      - Review pricing against costs
      - Ensure competitive pricing is sustainable
      - Document non-predatory intent
      - Consult antitrust counsel
  - id: PREDPRICE-HIGH-002
    signal: Information asymmetry exploited for pricing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Prices based on consumer ignorance
    - Hiding true costs until commitment
    - Exploiting lack of alternatives awareness
    - Using complexity to enable overcharging
    explanation: |
      Exploiting information asymmetry to charge more than
      informed consumers would pay is ethically problematic
      and may violate consumer protection laws.
    remediation: |
      - Improve price transparency
      - Simplify pricing structures
      - Ensure consumers can compare
      - Disclose all costs upfront
  medium:
  - id: PREDPRICE-MED-001
    signal: Excessive pricing without justification
    evidence_indicators:
    - Prices far above cost and market
    - No premium justification
    - Margins significantly above industry
    remediation: |
      - Review price/value alignment
      - Document pricing justification
      - Consider market positioning
      - Ensure perceived value matches price
  positive:
  - id: PREDPRICE-POS-001
    signal: Fair and transparent pricing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Pricing reflects value delivered
    - No vulnerability exploitation
    - Emergency protections in place
    - Competitive and sustainable
    - Transparent pricing structure
