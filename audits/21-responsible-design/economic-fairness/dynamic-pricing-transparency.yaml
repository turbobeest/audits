description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the fairness and transparency of dynamic pricing systems that
    adjust prices based on demand, user characteristics, or other factors.
    Assesses whether dynamic pricing is disclosed, whether personalized
    pricing discriminates unfairly, and whether consumers can understand
    and anticipate price changes.

    Examines pricing algorithms, disclosure practices, discrimination patterns,
    and consumer information about how prices are determined.
  why_it_matters: |
    Dynamic pricing raises ethical concerns:

    - Personalized pricing can discriminate against protected classes
    - Hidden dynamic pricing erodes consumer trust
    - Price discrimination based on user data raises privacy concerns
    - EU and FTC increasingly scrutinizing personalized pricing
    - Surge pricing during emergencies can constitute gouging
    - Consumers expect price transparency and fairness
  when_to_run:
  - When using dynamic or personalized pricing
  - During pricing system implementation
  - For regulatory compliance review
  - When pricing complaints arise
prerequisites:
  required_artifacts:
  - type: pricing_algorithm
    description: Documentation of dynamic pricing logic
  - type: pricing_factors
    description: Factors used in pricing decisions
  access_requirements:
  - Pricing algorithm documentation
  - Factor analysis access
  - Interview access to pricing team
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Pricing/Revenue Lead
    questions:
    - What factors influence dynamic pricing?
    - Are prices personalized to individual users?
    - How is dynamic pricing disclosed to users?
    - What constraints prevent discriminatory pricing?
    - Can users see how their price was determined?
    purpose: Understand dynamic pricing system
    duration: 45 min
  - role: Legal/Compliance
    questions:
    - How do you ensure pricing doesn't discriminate?
    - What disclosure requirements apply?
    - Have pricing complaints been received?
    - What regulatory risks exist?
    purpose: Understand compliance posture
    duration: 30 min

    - Personalization methods
    - Discrimination safeguards
    - Price bounds
  - type: Pricing Disclosure
    purpose: Review consumer communication
    look_for:

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DYNPRICE-CRIT-001
    signal: Dynamic pricing discriminates by protected class
    evidence_indicators:
    - Prices correlate with race, gender, or protected classes
    - Location used as proxy for demographics
    - Systematic price differences by demographic
    - No discrimination testing
    explanation: |
      Dynamic pricing that discriminates by protected class violates
      civil rights laws and causes direct harm to protected groups.
    remediation: |
      - Audit pricing for discrimination
      - Remove discriminatory factors
      - Test for disparate impact
      - Document non-discrimination compliance
  - id: DYNPRICE-CRIT-002
    signal: Personalized pricing without disclosure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users don't know prices are personalized
    - Different users see different prices without explanation
    - No disclosure of dynamic pricing
    - Price variation hidden from consumers
    explanation: |
      Hidden personalized pricing violates consumer trust and may
      violate consumer protection requirements for price transparency.
    remediation: |
      - Disclose dynamic/personalized pricing
      - Explain factors affecting price
      - Show price range or baseline
      - Allow price comparison
  high:
  - id: DYNPRICE-HIGH-001
    signal: Pricing uses sensitive personal data
    evidence_indicators:
    - Browsing history affects pricing
    - Past purchase willingness to pay exploited
    - Personal data used without consent for pricing
    - Device/wealth signals used for pricing
    explanation: |
      Using personal data for pricing without consent raises privacy
      concerns and may violate data protection regulations.
    remediation: |
      - Review data use in pricing
      - Obtain consent for personalized pricing
      - Limit sensitive data use
      - Disclose data-based pricing
  - id: DYNPRICE-HIGH-002
    signal: Price volatility without consumer protection
    evidence_indicators:
    - Prices change dramatically within sessions
    - No price locks or holds
    - Prices increase when users show interest
    - No protection from rapid price changes
    explanation: |
      Extreme price volatility without protection exploits consumers
      and creates pressure for hasty decisions.
    remediation: |
      - Implement price holds
      - Limit intra-session price changes
      - Don't increase price based on interest
      - Provide price protection windows
  medium:
  - id: DYNPRICE-MED-001
    signal: Dynamic pricing factors unclear to users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users can't understand why prices differ
    - Pricing factors not documented
    - No way to see what affects price
    remediation: |
      - Document pricing factors
      - Provide user-facing explanation
      - Show which factors affect their price
  positive:
  - id: DYNPRICE-POS-001
    signal: Transparent and fair dynamic pricing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dynamic pricing disclosed clearly
    - Factors explained to users
    - No discrimination by protected class
    - Price volatility controlled
    - User data use limited and consented
