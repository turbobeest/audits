  what: |
    Evaluates whether engagement metrics and success criteria incentivize
    manipulation or respect user wellbeing. Assesses whether metrics like
    DAU, time-on-site, sessions, and engagement drive design decisions
    that prioritize business goals over user benefit.

    Examines how metrics shape product decisions and whether wellbeing
    metrics balance engagement metrics.
  why_it_matters: |
    Metrics shape behavior - what gets measured gets optimized:

    - Pure engagement metrics incentivize addictive design
    - Lack of wellbeing metrics means wellbeing ignored
    - Metrics determine what teams are rewarded for
    - Engagement without value is extraction, not service
    - Regulators and investors increasingly scrutinize metrics
    - Metric misalignment creates systemic harm
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing product metrics
  - During strategic reviews
  - When products show signs of unhealthy engagement
  - During ethical design reviews

  access_requirements:
  - Metrics documentation

discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Product Leadership
    questions:
    - What metrics define product success?
    - How are engagement metrics balanced with wellbeing?
    - What happens when engagement conflicts with user benefit?
    - Are there any metrics you won't optimize?
    purpose: Understand metric philosophy
    duration: 45 min
  - role: Data/Analytics Lead
    questions:
    - What engagement metrics are tracked?
    - Are any wellbeing metrics measured?
    - How do metrics inform product decisions?
    - What would a 'healthy' user look like in your data?
    purpose: Understand metric implementation
    duration: 30 min

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ENGAGE-CRIT-001
    signal: Pure engagement metrics with no wellbeing balance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Time-on-site/DAU/sessions as primary success
    - No wellbeing metrics tracked
    - Engagement optimized without limits
    - No guardrails on engagement optimization
    explanation: |
      When engagement metrics alone define success, teams are
      incentivized to maximize time/sessions regardless of whether
      users benefit. This systematically produces manipulative design.
    remediation: |
      - Add wellbeing metrics to success criteria
      - Establish engagement guardrails
      - Define 'healthy' engagement targets
      - Balance engagement with value metrics
  - id: ENGAGE-CRIT-002
    signal: Teams rewarded for maximizing problematic metrics
    evidence_indicators:
    - Bonuses tied to engagement without wellbeing
    - OKRs purely engagement-focused
    - Promotions based on engagement gains
    - No accountability for wellbeing impact
    explanation: |
      When incentive structures reward pure engagement, individuals
      and teams are systematically incentivized to create addictive
      features regardless of user harm.
    remediation: |
      - Include wellbeing in team metrics
      - Add guardrail metrics to incentives
      - Create accountability for manipulation
      - Reward sustainable engagement
  high:
  - id: ENGAGE-HIGH-001
    signal: Engagement metrics trump user value in decisions
    evidence_indicators:
    - Features shipped that increase engagement but not value
    - Design decisions favor engagement over user benefit
    - Product roadmap driven by engagement gains
    - User benefit secondary to engagement
    explanation: |
      When engagement consistently wins over user value in product
      decisions, the result is systematic optimization against users.
    remediation: |
      - Require user value justification
      - Balance engagement with value metrics
      - Establish decision frameworks including wellbeing
  - id: ENGAGE-HIGH-002
    signal: No definition of healthy engagement
    evidence_indicators:
    - No distinction between healthy and unhealthy usage
    - All engagement treated as equally good
    - Excessive usage celebrated rather than questioned
    - No upper bounds on engagement targets
    explanation: |
      Without defining healthy engagement, teams have no basis for
      limiting optimization and no way to recognize when engagement
      becomes problematic.
    remediation: |
      - Define healthy engagement benchmarks
      - Identify excessive usage patterns
      - Set engagement ceilings for optimization
      - Measure and flag problematic usage
  medium:
  - id: ENGAGE-MED-001
    signal: Wellbeing metrics exist but aren't prioritized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Wellbeing metrics tracked but not acted on
    - Engagement metric improvements celebrated despite wellbeing decline
    - Wellbeing metrics not in primary dashboard
    remediation: |
      - Elevate wellbeing metrics visibility"
      - Include in primary success criteria"
      - Create accountability for wellbeing metrics"
  positive:
  - id: ENGAGE-POS-001
    signal: Balanced metric framework
    evidence_indicators:
    - Wellbeing metrics alongside engagement
    - Healthy engagement defined
    - Guardrails prevent problematic optimization
    - Team incentives balance engagement and wellbeing
