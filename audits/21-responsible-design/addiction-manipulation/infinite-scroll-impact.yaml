  what: |
    Evaluates the use of infinite scroll and its impact on user wellbeing.
    Assesses whether endless content feeds eliminate natural stopping points,
    whether users can track time and progress, and whether the pattern
    is designed to maximize engagement regardless of user benefit.

    Examines content feed design, stopping cues, time awareness features,
    and user control over consumption.
  why_it_matters: |
    Infinite scroll is linked to problematic technology use:

    - Eliminates natural stopping points users would otherwise have
    - Exploits variable reward psychology
    - Contributes to excessive screen time and wellbeing issues
    - EU Digital Services Act targets addictive design features
    - Parents, educators, and regulators increasingly concerned
    - Brand risk from association with addictive design
  when_to_run:
  - When designing content feed features
  - During ethical design reviews
  - When targeting younger audiences
  - After concerns about engagement patterns

  - type: feed_design
    description: Content feed implementation and design
  - type: product_access
    description: Access to test feeds
  access_requirements:
  - Test account access
  - Feed design documentation
  - Interview access to product team
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Product Manager
    questions:
    - Why was infinite scroll chosen over pagination?
    - What stopping cues exist for users?
    - How do you measure healthy vs. unhealthy engagement?
    - What user wellbeing features exist?
    purpose: Understand design rationale and wellbeing considerations
    duration: 30 min
  - role: UX Designer
    questions:
    - How do you help users track time spent?
    - What natural stopping points exist?
    - Were wellbeing concerns considered in design?
    purpose: Understand design choices

signals:
  critical:
  - id: INFINITE-CRIT-001
    signal: No stopping cues in content feed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Truly infinite content with no end
    - No time or content consumed indicators
    - No suggested stopping points
    - No 'you're all caught up' messages
    explanation: |
      Feeds without stopping cues exploit human psychology to maximize
      engagement without regard for user wellbeing. This is increasingly
      viewed as manipulative design.
    remediation: |
      - Add natural stopping points
      - Show time spent indicators
      - Implement 'caught up' messages
      - Consider pagination for some content
  high:
  - id: INFINITE-HIGH-001
    signal: No time awareness features
    evidence_indicators:
    - No indication of time spent
    - No session reminders
    - Clock hidden during use
    - No usage tracking for users
    explanation: |
      Without time awareness, users lose track of time spent.
      This is particularly problematic for younger users.
    remediation: |
      - Show time spent in session
      - Implement optional time reminders
      - Provide usage dashboards
      - Make clock visible
  - id: INFINITE-HIGH-002
    signal: Design optimized for maximum scroll time
    evidence_indicators:
    - A/B tests measure scroll time as success
    - Engagement metrics prioritize time over value
    - Design explicitly maximizes time on feed
    explanation: |
      When design explicitly maximizes time regardless of user benefit,
      this constitutes engagement optimization without ethical bounds.
    remediation: |
      - Balance engagement with wellbeing metrics
      - Define healthy engagement targets
      - Consider value delivered, not just time
  medium:
  - id: INFINITE-MED-001
    signal: Limited user control over feed experience
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot choose pagination
    - Cannot limit session time
    - No content throttling options
    remediation: |
      - Provide user control over feed format
      - Offer pagination option
      - Allow users to set limits
  positive:
  - id: INFINITE-POS-001
    signal: Wellbeing-aware infinite scroll
    evidence_indicators:
    - Time spent indicators shown
    - '''You''re caught up'' implemented'
    - Natural stopping points exist
    - User wellbeing considered in metrics
