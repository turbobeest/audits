  what: |
    Evaluates whether the product exploits Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) to
    drive engagement. Assesses time-limited content, disappearing features,
    scarcity messaging, social comparison, and other tactics that create
    anxiety about missing something.

    Examines whether FOMO is used as a deliberate engagement strategy
    rather than reflecting genuine scarcity or time-sensitivity.
  why_it_matters: |
    FOMO exploitation harms user wellbeing:

    - Creates anxiety and compulsive checking
    - Exploits psychological vulnerability
    - Particularly harmful for younger users
    - Often based on artificial rather than real scarcity
    - Undermines user autonomy
    - Increasingly scrutinized by regulators
  when_to_run:
  - When designing time-sensitive features
  - During ethical design reviews
  - When using scarcity messaging
  - After concerns about user anxiety
prerequisites:
  required_artifacts:
  - type: scarcity_features
    description: Documentation of time-limited or scarce features
  - type: product_access
    description: Access to test FOMO-inducing features
  access_requirements:
  - Test account access
  - Feature documentation
  - Marketing materials
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Product Manager
    questions:
    - What time-limited or disappearing content exists?
    - How is scarcity used in the product?
    - What creates urgency for users to engage?
    - How do you balance urgency with user wellbeing?
    purpose: Understand FOMO feature design
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Marketing/Growth Lead
    questions:
    - How is scarcity messaging used?
    - What FOMO tactics are employed in campaigns?
    - How do you create urgency?
    purpose: Understand FOMO in marketing
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Time-Limited Feature Documentation
    purpose: Review disappearing/limited content
    look_for:
    - Ephemeral content design
    - Limited-time offers
    - Artificial vs real scarcity
  - type: Marketing Campaigns
    purpose: Review FOMO messaging
    look_for:
    - Urgency language
    - Scarcity claims
    - Social comparison

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FOMO-CRIT-001
    signal: Fabricated scarcity to create urgency
    evidence_indicators:
    - Fake countdown timers that reset
    - Artificial inventory limits
    - '''Only X left'' claims that aren''t true'
    - Manufactured limited-time offers
    explanation: |
      Fabricating scarcity is deceptive practice that exploits FOMO
      through false claims about availability or timing.
    remediation: |
      - Only claim scarcity when real
      - Remove fake countdown timers
      - Be honest about availability
      - Audit scarcity claims for accuracy
  high:
  - id: FOMO-HIGH-001
    signal: Disappearing content creates compulsive checking
    evidence_indicators:
    - Content expires without archive
    - Important information time-limited
    - Users anxious about missing ephemeral content
    - Design maximizes FOMO around disappearance
    explanation: |
      Ephemeral content designed to create FOMO exploits psychological
      vulnerability to drive engagement through anxiety.
    remediation: |
      - Consider content archives
      - Don't make important content ephemeral
      - Provide notifications before expiry
      - Assess genuine need for time limits
  - id: FOMO-HIGH-002
    signal: Social comparison designed to create envy
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''X friends are doing Y'' messaging'
    - Others' activity highlighted to create envy
    - Comparison features promote FOMO
    - Design emphasizes what others have
    explanation: |
      Social comparison features that highlight what users are missing
      exploit FOMO through envy and social anxiety.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce comparison-focused features
      - Don't highlight what users are missing
      - Focus on user's own experience
      - Consider wellbeing impact of comparisons
  medium:
  - id: FOMO-MED-001
    signal: Urgency language overused
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Don''t miss out'' in non-urgent contexts'
    - Urgency language in routine communications
    - Everything presented as time-sensitive
    remediation: |
      - Reserve urgency for genuine urgency
      - Remove FOMO language from routine communications
      - Audit copy for exploitation
  positive:
  - id: FOMO-POS-001
    signal: Honest scarcity and no FOMO exploitation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Scarcity claims accurate
    - No psychological manipulation around time
    - Users not pressured by artificial urgency
    - FOMO not used as engagement strategy
