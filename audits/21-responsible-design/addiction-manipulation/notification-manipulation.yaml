  what: |
    Evaluates whether push notifications, emails, and alerts are designed
    to manipulate users into app engagement rather than serve genuine user
    needs. Assesses notification relevance, frequency, timing, psychological
    triggers, and user control over notification settings.

    Examines whether notifications create FOMO, artificial urgency, or
    interrupt users unnecessarily.
  why_it_matters: |
    Manipulative notifications harm user wellbeing:

    - Constant interruptions affect focus and mental health
    - FOMO-inducing notifications exploit psychological vulnerabilities
    - Notification fatigue damages user relationship
    - Regulators increasingly scrutinize notification practices
    - Users resent manipulative notification patterns
  when_to_run:
  - When designing notification systems
  - During ethical design reviews
  - After user complaints about notifications
  - When notification metrics show user fatigue
prerequisites:
  required_artifacts:
  - type: notification_system
    description: Documentation of notification types and triggers
  - type: product_access
    description: Access to receive and review notifications
  access_requirements:
  - Test account access
  - Notification configuration documentation
  - Interview access to product and growth teams
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Product Manager
    questions:
    - What triggers each notification type?
    - How do you measure notification effectiveness?
    - What controls do users have over notifications?
    - How do you balance engagement with user experience?
    purpose: Understand notification strategy
    duration: 30 min
  - role: Growth/Engagement Lead
    questions:
    - What A/B tests have been run on notifications?
    - How are notification timing and frequency determined?
    - What psychological principles inform notification design?
    purpose: Understand growth optimization practices
    duration: 30 min
  documents_to_review:

    look_for:
    - Trigger conditions
    - User value of each notification
    - Frequency and timing
  - type: Notification Settings
    purpose: Assess user control

    - Granularity of control
    - Default settings
    - Ease of modification

signals:
  critical:
  - id: NOTIF-CRIT-001
    signal: Fabricated notifications to drive engagement
    evidence_indicators:
    - Notifications about fake activity
    - Manufactured urgency or scarcity
    - Notifications for low-value events to draw users in
    - '''Someone might have viewed your profile'' type tactics'
    explanation: |
      Fabricating or exaggerating notification triggers is deceptive
      manipulation that violates user trust and may constitute
      unfair practice.
    remediation: |
      - Only notify for genuine, relevant events
      - Never fabricate activity
      - Ensure notification content is accurate
      - Audit for manufactured urgency
  - id: NOTIF-CRIT-002
    signal: Cannot disable non-essential notifications
    evidence_indicators:
    - Essential and promotional notifications bundled
    - No way to turn off marketing notifications
    - Must accept all or lose critical notifications
    explanation: |
      Users must be able to control non-essential notifications.
      Bundling with essential notifications is manipulative.
    remediation: |
      - Provide granular notification control
      - Separate essential from promotional
      - Allow disabling marketing independently
  high:
  - id: NOTIF-HIGH-001
    signal: Notifications designed to create FOMO
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Don''t miss out'' language'
    - Activity of others highlighted to create envy
    - Limited time/quantity urgency
    - Social comparison triggers
    explanation: |
      FOMO-inducing notifications exploit psychological vulnerabilities
      to drive engagement regardless of user benefit.
    remediation: |
      - Remove FOMO language
      - Focus on user value, not social comparison
      - Remove artificial urgency
      - Audit for psychological manipulation
  - id: NOTIF-HIGH-002
    signal: Excessive notification frequency
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple notifications per hour
    - Notifications for trivial events
    - Re-engagement notifications when user explicitly left
    - Notification fatigue evident in opt-out rates
    explanation: |
      Excessive notifications interrupt users and indicate engagement
      optimization over user respect.
    remediation: |
      - Implement intelligent notification throttling
      - Aggregate low-priority notifications
      - Respect user attention
      - Monitor opt-out rates as health signal
  medium:
  - id: NOTIF-MED-001
    signal: Notifications timed to maximize interruption
    evidence_indicators:
    - Notifications sent during typical sleep hours
    - Timing optimized for maximum open rate vs. user convenience
    - No respect for do-not-disturb preferences
    remediation: |
      - Implement smart timing based on user preferences
      - Respect do-not-disturb
      - Consider user timezone and patterns
      - Prioritize user convenience
  positive:
  - id: NOTIF-POS-001
    signal: User-respectful notification practices
    evidence_indicators:
    - Notifications for genuine user value only
    - Granular user control
    - Intelligent throttling and batching
    - No psychological manipulation
