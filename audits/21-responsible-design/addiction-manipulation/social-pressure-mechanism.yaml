  what: |
    Evaluates whether the product uses social pressure mechanisms to drive
    engagement through guilt, obligation, or fear of social consequences.
    Assesses read receipts, streaks, public activity indicators, and
    features that create social obligation or public accountability.

    Examines whether users are pressured to engage through social
    dynamics rather than genuine value.
  why_it_matters: |
    Social pressure mechanisms can harm wellbeing:

    - Create anxiety about social obligations
    - Manipulate users through fear of judgment
    - Particularly harmful for younger users
    - Can contribute to problematic technology use
    - Undermine authentic social connections
    - Subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny
  when_to_run:
  - When designing social features
  - During ethical design reviews
  - When targeting younger audiences
  - After concerns about social anxiety features
prerequisites:
  required_artifacts:
  - type: social_features
    description: Documentation of social interaction features
  - type: product_access
    description: Access to test social features
  access_requirements:
  - Test accounts (multiple for social testing)
  - Social feature documentation
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Product Manager
    questions:
    - What social pressure mechanisms exist in the product?
    - How do read receipts, streaks, or status indicators work?
    - What social obligations do features create?
    - How do you balance social engagement with user wellbeing?
    purpose: Understand social feature design
    duration: 30 min

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SOCIAL-CRIT-001
    signal: Mandatory public accountability mechanisms
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot disable read receipts
    - Activity forced to be public
    - Inactivity visible to others without control
    - Social judgment built into core experience
    explanation: |
      Mandatory social accountability that users cannot control
      creates unavoidable social pressure that can cause anxiety
      and compulsive usage.
    remediation: |
      - Make read receipts optional
      - Allow private activity
      - Give users control over visibility
      - Don't expose inactivity
  high:
  - id: SOCIAL-HIGH-001
    signal: Streak mechanisms create daily obligation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Loss of progress for missing a day
    - Streak visible to others
    - Guilt-inducing streak break messaging
    - Escalating investment in streak maintenance
    explanation: |
      Streak mechanisms create artificial daily obligations that
      prioritize engagement metrics over user autonomy and wellbeing.
    remediation: |
      - Consider non-streak engagement mechanisms
      - Allow streak freezes or flexibility
      - Don't make streaks public by default
      - Avoid guilt messaging on breaks
  - id: SOCIAL-HIGH-002
    signal: Read receipts create response pressure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Others see when message was read
    - Creates obligation to respond quickly
    - Anxiety about being seen but not responding
    - No option to disable
    explanation: |
      Read receipts create social pressure to respond immediately,
      contributing to anxiety and compulsive checking.
    remediation: |
      - Make read receipts optional
      - Allow individual control
      - Consider alternatives that respect privacy
  medium:
  - id: SOCIAL-MED-001
    signal: Public activity encourages performance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Activity visible to followers
    - Inactivity noticeable
    - Social pressure to maintain presence
    remediation: |
      - Allow private activity modes
      - Don't highlight inactivity
      - Respect user privacy preferences
  positive:
  - id: SOCIAL-POS-001
    signal: Social features respect user autonomy
    evidence_indicators:
    - Read receipts optional
    - Activity privacy controllable
    - No mandatory social accountability
    - Streaks flexible or optional
