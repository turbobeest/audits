  what: |
    Evaluates whether the product uses variable reward schedules - the
    psychological mechanism that makes gambling addictive - to drive user
    engagement. Assesses pull-to-refresh uncertainty, feed unpredictability,
    notification randomness, and other patterns that exploit variable
    reinforcement.

    Examines whether design deliberately creates unpredictability to
    maximize checking behavior and engagement.
  why_it_matters: |
    Variable reward schedules are powerful manipulation mechanisms:

    - Core mechanism behind gambling addiction
    - Creates compulsive checking behavior
    - Exploits fundamental psychology for engagement
    - Particularly harmful for children and vulnerable users
    - Increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny
    - Ethically problematic when used knowingly
  when_to_run:
  - When designing engagement features
  - During ethical design reviews
  - When products target younger users
  - After concerns about compulsive usage

    description: Access to experience product patterns
  access_requirements:
  - Test account access
  - Reward system documentation
  - Interview access to product and psychology resources
discovery:
  interviews:
  - role: Product Manager
    questions:
    - How is content or rewards delivered to users?
    - What creates unpredictability in the user experience?
    - Were variable reward principles considered in design?
    - How do you define healthy vs. compulsive engagement?
    purpose: Understand reward delivery design
    duration: 45 min
  - role: Data Science/Personalization Lead
    questions:
    - How does the recommendation algorithm create variety?
    - What factors determine content delivery timing?
    - How is feed ordering randomized or personalized?
    purpose: Understand technical implementation

signals:
  critical:
  - id: VARIABLE-CRIT-001
    signal: Deliberate variable reward schedule implementation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Design documents reference variable reinforcement
    - Unpredictability explicitly designed in
    - A/B tests optimize for checking frequency
    - Gambling psychology principles applied
    explanation: |
      Deliberately implementing gambling-style variable rewards is
      manipulative design that exploits known psychological
      vulnerabilities for engagement.
    remediation: |
      - Remove deliberately random reward elements
      - Consider predictable alternatives
      - If randomness needed, add transparency
      - Document ethical review of mechanisms
  high:
  - id: VARIABLE-HIGH-001
    signal: Pull-to-refresh creates slot machine experience
    evidence_indicators:
    - Refresh reveals unpredictable new content
    - Users repeatedly refresh seeking novelty
    - Refresh designed to deliver variable rewards
    - No indication of what refresh will bring
    explanation: |
      Pull-to-refresh that creates gambling-like uncertainty exploits
      variable reinforcement psychology to drive compulsive checking.
    remediation: |
      - Indicate what's new before refresh
      - Consider time-based content release
      - Reduce uncertainty in refresh experience
      - Add predictability cues
  - id: VARIABLE-HIGH-002
    signal: Feed unpredictability maximized
    evidence_indicators:
    - High-value content randomly distributed
    - Algorithm optimizes for uncertainty
    - Users cannot predict when good content appears
    - Discovery designed as variable reward
    explanation: |
      When feeds are designed to maximize unpredictability of valued
      content, this creates slot machine dynamics that drive
      compulsive engagement.
    remediation: |
      - Consider more predictable content organization
      - Allow chronological or user-controlled ordering
      - Reduce algorithmic randomization
      - Provide content quality indicators
  medium:
  - id: VARIABLE-MED-001
    signal: Notification timing creates uncertainty
    evidence_indicators:
    - Notifications batched and delayed for impact
    - Social validation notifications randomized
    - Users cannot predict when notifications arrive
    remediation: |
      - Consider more predictable notification delivery
      - Avoid gaming notification timing
      - Respect user preference for timing
  positive:
  - id: VARIABLE-POS-001
    signal: Predictable reward delivery
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users can anticipate content/rewards
    - Chronological options available
    - Transparency about content delivery
    - No deliberate gambling mechanisms
