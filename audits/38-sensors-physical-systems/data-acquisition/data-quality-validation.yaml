description:
  what: |
    Reviews data quality validation mechanisms including range checking, rate-of-change
    limits, plausibility tests, cross-sensor validation, outlier detection, and data
    integrity verification. Examines how bad data is identified, flagged, and handled.
  why_it_matters: |
    Unvalidated sensor data can contain errors from sensor failures, noise, interference,
    or communication issues. Using bad data for control or decisions can cause system
    failures, safety incidents, or incorrect process outcomes. Data quality gates
    prevent corrupted data from affecting downstream systems.
  when_to_run:
  - During data acquisition design
  - After sensor integration
  - When data quality issues observed
  - Before system validation
  - During safety reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SPS-DQV-CRIT-001
    signal: Safety-critical data not validated
    evidence_indicators:
    - No range checking on safety inputs
    - No plausibility tests for critical data
    - Bad data passed to safety functions
    explanation: |
      Safety functions relying on unvalidated sensor data can make incorrect
      decisions based on corrupted readings, potentially causing hazardous
      conditions or failing to respond to real hazards.
    remediation: Implement comprehensive validation for all safety-critical data
  - id: SPS-DQV-CRIT-002
    signal: Data validation failures not detected
    evidence_indicators:
    - Validation errors silently ignored
    - No logging of quality issues
    - System unaware of bad data
    explanation: |
      When data validation fails silently, operators and systems remain
      unaware of data quality problems. This can lead to accumulated errors
      and delayed discovery of sensor issues.
    remediation: Implement validation failure detection with appropriate alerting
  high:
  - id: SPS-DQV-HIGH-001
    signal: Range limits inappropriate for application
    evidence_indicators:
    - Limits too wide to catch errors
    - Limits too tight causing false alarms
    - Limits not based on physical constraints
    remediation: Review and adjust validation limits based on application requirements
  - id: SPS-DQV-HIGH-002
    signal: No rate-of-change validation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Step changes not detected
    - Unrealistic transitions accepted
    - Sensor failures appear as valid data
    remediation: Implement rate-of-change limits based on physical constraints
  medium:
  - id: SPS-DQV-MED-001
    signal: Cross-sensor validation not implemented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Redundant sensors not compared
    - Related measurements not correlated
    - Inconsistencies not detected
    remediation: Implement cross-sensor validation for redundant and related sensors
  - id: SPS-DQV-MED-002
    signal: Bad data handling inconsistent
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different approaches for different sensors
    - No standard bad data response
    - Substitution rules unclear
    remediation: Standardize bad data handling procedures
