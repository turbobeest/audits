description:
  what: |
    Examines sensor network architecture including topology design (star, bus,
    mesh, tree), addressing schemes, network segmentation, bandwidth allocation,
    latency characteristics, and scalability considerations. Reviews physical
    wiring, wireless connectivity, and hybrid network designs.
  why_it_matters: |
    Network topology affects system reliability, latency, bandwidth, fault tolerance,
    and maintainability. Poor topology design can create bottlenecks, single points
    of failure, or scalability limitations that impact system performance and
    availability.
  when_to_run:
  - During system architecture design
  - Before network expansion
  - When experiencing network issues
  - During capacity planning
  - After topology changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SPS-NET-CRIT-001
    signal: Single point of failure in sensor network
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single gateway for all sensors
    - No redundant communication paths
    - Critical sensors on single bus segment
    explanation: |
      A single point of failure can cause loss of all sensor data, potentially
      causing system shutdown or unsafe operation. Redundancy is essential for
      critical sensor networks.
    remediation: Implement redundant communication paths for critical sensors
  - id: SPS-NET-CRIT-002
    signal: Network latency exceeds control system requirements
    evidence_indicators:
    - Update rates not met
    - Control loop instability
    - Excessive network delays
    explanation: |
      Control systems require sensor data within specified time bounds. Excessive
      latency can cause control instability or safety system timing failures.
    remediation: Optimize network design to meet latency requirements

  - id: SPS-NET-HIGH-001
    signal: Network bandwidth insufficient for all sensors
    evidence_indicators:
    - Network congestion observed
