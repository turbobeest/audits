description:
  what: |
    Evaluates pneumatic actuation systems including air supply quality, pressure
    regulation, cylinder sizing, valve configuration, speed control, and safety
    exhaust. Reviews instrument air quality, leak detection, and energy efficiency.
  why_it_matters: |
    Pneumatic systems power many industrial actuators. Poor air quality damages
    components, inadequate supply causes slow or erratic operation, and leaks
    waste significant energy. Proper pneumatic system management ensures reliable
    operation and efficiency.
  when_to_run:
  - During system commissioning
  - When actuation issues occur
  - During energy audits
  - After compressor changes
  - During leak surveys

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SPS-PNU-CRIT-001
    signal: Safety exhaust function not working
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cylinder does not exhaust on E-stop
    - Dump valve failed
    - Residual pressure hazard
    explanation: |
      Safety exhaust functions remove air pressure from actuators during
      emergency stops. Failure leaves actuators pressurized, creating
      potential energy hazards for personnel.
    remediation: Repair safety exhaust function immediately
  - id: SPS-PNU-CRIT-002
    signal: Air supply contamination causing failures
    evidence_indicators:
    - Water in air lines
    - Oil contamination
    - Particulate causing valve failures
    explanation: |
      Contaminated air damages pneumatic components, causes erratic operation,
      and can lead to safety issues from actuator malfunctions.
    remediation: Address contamination source and clean/replace affected components
  high:
  - id: SPS-PNU-HIGH-001
    signal: Insufficient air supply pressure
    evidence_indicators:
