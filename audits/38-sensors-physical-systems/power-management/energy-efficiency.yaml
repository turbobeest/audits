description:
  what: |
    Evaluates energy efficiency of sensor and control systems including power
    consumption measurement, sleep/low-power modes, efficient component selection,
    and power management strategies. Reviews opportunities for reducing energy
    consumption while maintaining functionality.
  why_it_matters: |
    Energy efficiency reduces operating costs, extends battery life in remote
    systems, and supports sustainability goals. Efficient systems generate less
    heat, improving reliability and reducing cooling requirements.
  when_to_run:
  - During system design
  - During energy audits
  - When optimizing costs
  - Before battery-powered deployment
  - When expanding systems
