description:
  what: |
    Evaluates power supply monitoring for sensors, controllers, and instrumentation.
    Reviews voltage monitoring, current measurement, power quality detection, and
    alarm thresholds. Assesses redundant power supply supervision and failure
    prediction capabilities.
  why_it_matters: |
    Power supply problems are a leading cause of equipment failures. Early detection
    of power issues enables proactive response before complete failure. Monitoring
    enables predictive maintenance and reduces unplanned downtime.
  when_to_run:
  - During system design
  - After power issues
  - During reliability reviews
  - When adding equipment
  - After power infrastructure changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SPS-PWM-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical power supply not monitored
    evidence_indicators:
    - No voltage monitoring
    - Power failure undetectable
    - No advance warning
    explanation: |
      Unmonitored power supplies can fail without warning, causing immediate
      loss of critical systems. Monitoring enables detection of degradation
      before failure.
    remediation: Implement power supply monitoring
  - id: SPS-PWM-CRIT-002
    signal: Redundant supply failure not detected
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single supply failed unnoticed
    - Running without redundancy
    - Next failure causes outage
    explanation: |
      Redundant power supplies provide fault tolerance, but only if failures
      are detected. Undetected failures leave systems vulnerable to the
      next failure.
    remediation: Implement redundancy monitoring with alerting
  high:
  - id: SPS-PWM-HIGH-001
    signal: Power quality affecting equipment
    evidence_indicators:

    remediation: Improve power conditioning or filtering
  - id: SPS-PWM-HIGH-002
    signal: Power supply operating near limits
    evidence_indicators:
    - Voltage at edge of tolerance
    - Current near rated capacity
    - Temperature elevated
    remediation: Address root cause or upgrade capacity
  medium:
  - id: SPS-PWM-MED-001
    signal: Power monitoring coverage incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some supplies not monitored
    - Not all parameters tracked

    remediation: Extend monitoring coverage
  - id: SPS-PWM-MED-002
    signal: Alarm thresholds not optimized
