description:
  what: |
    Evaluates HVAC system monitoring including supply/return temperatures, duct
    pressures, air flow rates, filter differential pressures, damper positions,
    and equipment status. Reviews BACnet/Modbus integration, trend logging, and
    alarm configuration for building automation systems.
  why_it_matters: |
    HVAC systems significantly impact energy consumption, occupant comfort,
    equipment reliability, and indoor air quality. Comprehensive monitoring
    enables optimization, predictive maintenance, and rapid response to
    environmental deviations.
  when_to_run:
  - During BMS commissioning
  - After HVAC modifications
  - During energy audits
  - When comfort complaints arise
  - During seasonal transitions

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SPS-HVC-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical environment HVAC failure undetected
    evidence_indicators:
    - Data center cooling loss
    - Cleanroom pressure loss
    - No alarm on equipment failure
    explanation: |
      Critical environments like data centers, cleanrooms, and laboratories
      require continuous HVAC operation. Undetected failures can cause
      equipment damage, contamination, or process failures.
    remediation: Implement comprehensive equipment and environmental monitoring
  - id: SPS-HVC-CRIT-002
    signal: Ventilation inadequate for safety requirements
    evidence_indicators:
    - Air changes below minimum
    - Exhaust system not monitored
    - Pressure relationships wrong
    explanation: |
      Safety-critical ventilation (fume hoods, isolation rooms, hazardous
      areas) must maintain required air flow and pressure relationships.
      Inadequate ventilation can expose personnel to hazards.
    remediation: Verify and monitor safety ventilation systems
  high:
  - id: SPS-HVC-HIGH-001
    signal: Temperature/humidity control unstable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Large swings around setpoint
    - Unable to maintain conditions
    - Control loops hunting
    remediation: Tune control loops, verify sensor accuracy
  - id: SPS-HVC-HIGH-002
    signal: Equipment status monitoring incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - Fan status not monitored
    - Compressor run-hours unknown
    - Filter status not tracked
    remediation: Implement comprehensive equipment monitoring
  medium:
  - id: SPS-HVC-MED-001
    signal: Trend logging insufficient
    evidence_indicators:
    - Key points not trended
    - Trend interval too long
    - History not retained
    remediation: Configure comprehensive trend logging
  - id: SPS-HVC-MED-002
    signal: Alarm configuration inadequate
    evidence_indicators:
    - No alarm delays for transients
    - Alarm limits too wide
    - Alarm suppression during occupied hours
    remediation: Optimize alarm configuration
  low:
  - id: SPS-HVC-LOW-001
    signal: Point naming inconsistent
    evidence_indicators:
    - No naming standard
    - Points hard to identify
    - Documentation mismatch
    remediation: Standardize point naming
  - id: SPS-HVC-LOW-002
    signal: Graphics not current
    evidence_indicators:
    - Graphics don't match field
    - Missing equipment on graphics
    - Outdated setpoints displayed
    remediation: Update BMS graphics
