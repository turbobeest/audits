description:
  what: |
    Evaluates humidity sensing systems including sensor technology selection
    (capacitive, resistive, thermal conductivity), placement, accuracy across
    the operating range, response time, calibration, and integration with
    temperature measurement for dew point calculation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Humidity affects equipment reliability, product quality, and human comfort.
    Condensation can damage electronics, promote corrosion, or contaminate
    processes. Accurate humidity monitoring enables proper environmental control
    and prevents moisture-related failures.
  when_to_run:
  - During environmental monitoring design
  - When humidity issues arise
  - After sensor replacement
  - During calibration reviews
  - Before environmental qualification

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SPS-HUM-CRIT-001
    signal: Humidity measurement failure affecting critical process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Humidity-critical process out of control
    - Condensation damage occurring
    - Sensor failed without detection
    explanation: |
      Undetected humidity measurement failure can lead to condensation,
      corrosion, product contamination, or electrostatic discharge issues.
      Critical applications require reliable humidity monitoring.
    remediation: Replace sensor, implement redundancy and health monitoring
  - id: SPS-HUM-CRIT-002
    signal: Dew point calculation incorrect
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dew point below actual conditions
    - Condensation occurring despite monitoring
    - Temperature-humidity correlation error
    explanation: |
      Incorrect dew point calculation can allow condensation to form on
      cold surfaces, damaging equipment or products. The calculation
      requires accurate temperature and humidity inputs.
    remediation: Verify temperature and humidity sensors, correct calculation
  high:
  - id: SPS-HUM-HIGH-001
    signal: Humidity sensor saturation/contamination
    evidence_indicators:
    - Readings stuck at high value
    - Slow response after high humidity
    - Sensor exposed to condensation
    remediation: Replace saturated sensor, improve protection
  - id: SPS-HUM-HIGH-002
    signal: Sensor placement in non-representative location
    evidence_indicators:
    - Sensor in dead air zone
    - Local humidity different from process
    - Affected by local sources
    remediation: Relocate sensor to representative location
  medium:
  - id: SPS-HUM-MED-001
    signal: Calibration accuracy degraded
    evidence_indicators:
    - Drift since last calibration
    - Out of specification at extremes
    - Hysteresis increased
    remediation: Recalibrate or replace sensor
  - id: SPS-HUM-MED-002
    signal: Response time inadequate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot track rapid changes
    - Control lag issues
    - Filter housing too restrictive
    remediation: Select faster sensor or improve air circulation
