description:
  what: |
    Evaluates temperature sensing systems including sensor selection (thermocouples,
    RTDs, thermistors, IC sensors), placement, accuracy, response time, calibration,
    and signal conditioning. Reviews cold junction compensation for thermocouples,
    lead wire compensation for RTDs, and thermal coupling considerations.
  why_it_matters: |
    Temperature is often the most critical environmental parameter affecting
    equipment operation, product quality, and safety. Accurate temperature
    measurement enables proper process control, prevents equipment damage,
    and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.
  when_to_run:
  - During system design
  - When temperature issues arise
  - After sensor replacement
  - During calibration reviews
  - Before process validation

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SPS-TMP-CRIT-001
    signal: Safety-critical temperature measurement out of tolerance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Calibration deviation exceeds limits
    - Safety limit based on inaccurate reading
    - Process temperature actually exceeds safe limits
    explanation: |
      Safety-critical temperature measurements protect equipment and personnel.
      Inaccurate readings can allow dangerous overtemperature conditions or
      cause unnecessary shutdowns.
    remediation: Recalibrate or replace sensor, verify safety limits
  - id: SPS-TMP-CRIT-002
    signal: Thermocouple cold junction compensation failure
    evidence_indicators:
    - CJC sensor faulty or miscalibrated
    - Temperature reading drifts with ambient
    - Large measurement errors
    explanation: |
      Thermocouples require accurate cold junction compensation. CJC failures
      cause measurement errors that vary with ambient temperature, potentially
      masking or creating dangerous conditions.
    remediation: Verify and correct cold junction compensation
  high:
  - id: SPS-TMP-HIGH-001
    signal: Sensor placement not optimal
    evidence_indicators:
    - Sensor measures local not process temperature
    - Thermal lag excessive
    - Location affected by external sources
    remediation: Relocate sensor or add thermal coupling improvements
  - id: SPS-TMP-HIGH-002
    signal: Lead wire errors uncompensated
    evidence_indicators:
    - RTD lead resistance causes error
    - 2-wire RTD in long cable run
    - Thermocouple extension wire wrong type
    remediation: Use appropriate wiring configuration
  medium:
  - id: SPS-TMP-MED-001
    signal: Calibration interval inappropriate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Drift between calibrations
    - Interval not based on stability analysis
    - All sensors on same schedule
    remediation: Optimize calibration intervals based on drift analysis
  - id: SPS-TMP-MED-002
    signal: Response time inadequate for application
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot track rapid changes
    - Control loop unstable
    - Thermal mass too high
    remediation: Select sensor with appropriate response time

  - id: SPS-TMP-LOW-001
    signal: Temperature sensor selection not documented

    remediation: Document sensor selection rationale
  - id: SPS-TMP-LOW-002
    signal: No temperature trending analysis
    evidence_indicators:
    - Historical data not analyzed
    - Drift patterns unknown
    - Predictive maintenance not possible
    remediation: Implement temperature trending and analysis
