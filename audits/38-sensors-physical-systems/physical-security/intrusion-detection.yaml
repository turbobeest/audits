description:
  what: |
    Evaluates physical intrusion detection systems including perimeter protection,
    motion sensors, door/window contacts, glass break detectors, and fence
    sensors. Reviews sensor placement, detection coverage, alarm annunciation,
    and response procedures.
  why_it_matters: |
    Intrusion detection provides early warning of unauthorized access attempts.
    Effective detection enables timely response to prevent theft, sabotage,
    or unauthorized modification of critical equipment and systems.
  when_to_run:
  - During security design
  - After system modifications
  - During security audits
  - After intrusion events
  - During alarm verification

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SPS-IDS-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical area unprotected
    evidence_indicators:
    - No intrusion detection coverage
    - Sensors bypassed or disabled
    - Coverage gaps exploitable
    explanation: |
      Critical areas without intrusion detection are vulnerable to
      unauthorized access without warning. This can lead to theft,
      sabotage, or compromise of safety/security systems.
    remediation: Provide intrusion detection for all critical areas
  - id: SPS-IDS-CRIT-002
    signal: Alarm response not occurring
    evidence_indicators:
    - Alarms not reaching responders
    - Central station not connected
    - Response procedures not followed
    explanation: |
      Detection without response provides no security. If alarms don't
      trigger appropriate response, intruders can complete their
      objectives unimpeded.
    remediation: Verify and restore alarm response capability
  high:
  - id: SPS-IDS-HIGH-001
    signal: High false alarm rate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Frequent nuisance alarms
    - Alarms ignored by responders
    - System credibility lost
    remediation: Reduce false alarms through adjustment or replacement
  - id: SPS-IDS-HIGH-002
    signal: Detection sensitivity inadequate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Walk tests fail
    - Intruders not detected
    - Coverage holes found
    remediation: Adjust or add sensors for proper coverage
  medium:
  - id: SPS-IDS-MED-001
    signal: Alarm verification inadequate
    evidence_indicators:
    - No video verification
    - Single sensor activation only
    - Cannot confirm intrusion
    remediation: Implement alarm verification capability
  - id: SPS-IDS-MED-002
    signal: System supervision lacking
    evidence_indicators:
    - Sensor tamper not detected
    - Communication failure unannounced
    - Power failure not alarmed
    remediation: Implement comprehensive system supervision
  low:
  - id: SPS-IDS-LOW-001
    signal: Intrusion system not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Sensor locations unknown
    - Zones not documented
    - Response procedures missing
    remediation: Document intrusion detection system
  - id: SPS-IDS-LOW-002
    signal: No alarm trending
    evidence_indicators:
    - Alarm history not analyzed
    - Patterns not identified
    - No metrics tracked
    remediation: Implement alarm analysis and trending
  positive:
  - id: SPS-IDS-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive detection coverage
    evidence_indicators:
    - All critical areas protected
    - Proper sensor selection
    - Layered detection
  - id: SPS-IDS-POS-002
    signal: Effective alarm response
    evidence_indicators:
    - Quick response times
