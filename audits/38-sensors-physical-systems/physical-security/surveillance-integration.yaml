description:
  what: |
    Evaluates video surveillance and monitoring integration with control systems.
    Reviews camera placement, coverage, video analytics, alarm triggering,
    recording retention, and integration with access control and process events.
  why_it_matters: |
    Video surveillance provides visual verification of events, deters unauthorized
    activity, and supports incident investigation. Integration with control
    systems enables automatic camera positioning, event correlation, and more
    effective security response.
  when_to_run:
  - During surveillance design
  - After camera system changes
  - During security audits
  - After incidents requiring video
  - When coverage issues identified

  critical:
  - id: SPS-SRV-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical area without surveillance coverage
    evidence_indicators:
    - Security-critical area unmonitored
    - Blind spots in coverage
    - Camera out of service
    explanation: |
      Unmonitored critical areas allow unauthorized activity to go undetected
      and make incident investigation impossible. This creates security and
      safety risks.
    remediation: Provide surveillance coverage for critical areas
  - id: SPS-SRV-CRIT-002
    signal: Video recording not functioning
    evidence_indicators:
    - Recordings missing
    - Storage failure
    - Retention not met
    explanation: |
      Without video recordings, incident investigation is severely hampered.
      Regulatory requirements may mandate specific retention periods.
    remediation: Restore recording function and verify retention
  high:
  - id: SPS-SRV-HIGH-001
    signal: Video quality inadequate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot identify individuals
    - Low resolution or frame rate
    - Poor lighting compensation
    remediation: Improve camera quality or lighting
  - id: SPS-SRV-HIGH-002
    signal: Event-triggered recording not working
    evidence_indicators:
    - Alarms not triggering recording
    - Access events not captured
    - Process events not correlated
    remediation: Configure proper event triggering
  medium:
  - id: SPS-SRV-MED-001
    signal: Video analytics underutilized
    evidence_indicators:
    - No motion detection
    - No loitering detection
    - No perimeter alerts
    remediation: Implement applicable video analytics
  - id: SPS-SRV-MED-002
    signal: Video not integrated with control events
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot correlate video with process
    - No automatic camera call-up
    - Separate timestamp systems
    remediation: Integrate video with control system events
  low:
  - id: SPS-SRV-LOW-001
    signal: Surveillance system not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Camera locations not mapped
    - Coverage not documented
    - Integration not recorded
    remediation: Document surveillance system
  - id: SPS-SRV-LOW-002
    signal: No surveillance system health monitoring
    evidence_indicators:
    - Camera failures not detected
    - Storage not monitored
    - No system alerts
    remediation: Implement system health monitoring
