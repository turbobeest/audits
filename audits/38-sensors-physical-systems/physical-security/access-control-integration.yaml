description:
  what: |
    Evaluates integration between physical access control systems and control
    system operations. Reviews card readers, biometric systems, door controllers,
    and their integration with safety systems, process interlocks, and operational
    requirements.
  why_it_matters: |
    Physical access control protects personnel and equipment by restricting area
    access. Integration with control systems can enable or enforce safety
    procedures, prevent unauthorized operations, and create audit trails for
    regulatory compliance.
  when_to_run:
  - During access control design
  - After access system changes
  - During security audits
  - When operational issues arise
  - After security incidents

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SPS-ACC-CRIT-001
    signal: Access control bypass enables unsafe operations
    evidence_indicators:
    - Safety interlock bypassed by access
    - Unauthorized operation possible
    - Access not enforcing safety rules
    explanation: |
      Access control that fails to enforce safety requirements can allow
      unauthorized or unsafe operations, potentially leading to injury
      or equipment damage.
    remediation: Correct integration to enforce safety requirements
  - id: SPS-ACC-CRIT-002
    signal: Access system failure leaves area unsecured
    evidence_indicators:
    - Fail-open on power loss
    - No backup access control
    - Unauthorized access possible
    explanation: |
      Access control systems must fail to a secure state. Failure that
      allows unauthorized access defeats the purpose of the system and
      may violate security requirements.
    remediation: Implement fail-secure design with backup
  high:
  - id: SPS-ACC-HIGH-001
    signal: Access logging incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - Not all access logged
    - Logs not retained
    - Cannot audit access
    remediation: Implement comprehensive access logging
  - id: SPS-ACC-HIGH-002
    signal: Access permissions not synchronized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Physical and logical access different
    - Terminated personnel still have access
    - Permissions not reviewed
    remediation: Synchronize access systems and implement review
  medium:
  - id: SPS-ACC-MED-001
    signal: Anti-passback not enforced
    evidence_indicators:
    - Badge sharing possible
    - Tailgating not detected
    - Occupancy unknown
    remediation: Implement anti-passback where required
  - id: SPS-ACC-MED-002
    signal: Emergency egress affects security
    evidence_indicators:
    - REX creates security gap
    - Emergency doors not alarmed
    - Evacuation not logged
    remediation: Balance safety egress with security needs

    - Integration not documented
    - Access rules not recorded
    - Configuration unknown
    remediation: Document access control system
  - id: SPS-ACC-LOW-002
    signal: No access control metrics
