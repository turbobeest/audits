  what: |
    This audit examines the formal approval and sign-off process for
    requirements. It evaluates:
    - Sign-off process definition
    - Authorized approvers identified
    - Sign-off records maintained
    - Sign-off scope clarity
    - Conditional approvals handled
    - Sign-off timing appropriate

    - Creates formal commitment to requirements
    - Enables scope management
    - Provides change management baseline
    - Supports contract fulfillment
    - Enables accountability
    - Required for compliance and audit
