  what: |
    This audit examines the use of prototypes for requirements validation.
    It evaluates:
    - Prototype usage for validation
    - Prototype fidelity appropriateness
    - User feedback collection
    - Requirements refinement from prototypes
    - Prototype scope clarity
  why_it_matters: |
    Prototypes validate requirements before expensive development:
    - Users can interact with concrete representations
    - Abstract requirements become tangible
    - Usability issues discovered early
    - Scope clarified through visualization
    - Prevents building wrong product
    - Supports iterative requirement refinement

signals:
  high:
  - id: PROTO-HIGH-001
    signal: Complex UI without prototype validation
    evidence_indicators:
    - UI requirements without mockups
    - No user interaction validation
    - Usability untested before development
    remediation: |
      - Create prototypes for UI requirements
      - Validate with users
      - Collect and incorporate feedback
      - Update requirements based on validation
  - id: PROTO-HIGH-002
    signal: Prototype feedback not incorporated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Prototypes reviewed but requirements unchanged
    - Feedback collected but not acted on
    - No requirement updates from validation
    remediation: |
      - Review all prototype feedback
      - Update requirements based on feedback
      - Document requirement changes
      - Communicate updates to stakeholders
  medium:
  - id: PROTO-MED-001
    signal: Prototype scope unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - Prototype confused with final product
    - Expectations not managed
    - Scope boundaries undefined
    remediation: |
      - Document prototype scope
      - Clarify what is/isn't in scope
      - Manage stakeholder expectations
      - Label prototypes clearly
