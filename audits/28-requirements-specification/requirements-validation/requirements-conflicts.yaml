  what: |
    This audit examines how conflicts between requirements are identified
    and resolved. It evaluates:
    - Conflict detection process
    - Conflict documentation
    - Resolution process
    - Stakeholder involvement in resolution
    - Resolution documentation
    - Conflict prevention measures
  why_it_matters: |
    Requirements conflicts cause implementation impossibilities:
    - Conflicting requirements cannot both be implemented
    - Unresolved conflicts surface during development
    - Late conflict discovery is expensive
    - Stakeholder conflicts need explicit resolution
    - Conflict resolution requires authority
    - Documentation prevents re-emergence

    evidence_indicators:
    - Conflicts not systematically identified
    - No conflict review in requirements process
    - Conflicts discovered during development
    remediation: |
      - Include conflict detection in review process
      - Use conflict detection checklists
      - Compare related requirements
      - Train team on conflict identification
      - Document conflicts when found

    signal: Conflicts left unresolved
    evidence_indicators:
    - Known conflicts without resolution
    - Conflicting requirements both active
    - No resolution process
    remediation: |
      - Resolve all known conflicts
      - Define resolution process
      - Escalate to appropriate authority
      - Document resolutions
      - Update requirements

  - id: CONFLICT-HIGH-001
    signal: Resolution authority unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - No one authorized to resolve
    - Conflicts escalate without resolution
    - Authority not documented
    remediation: |
      - Define resolution authority
      - Document escalation path
      - Empower conflict resolution
      - Track resolution decisions
