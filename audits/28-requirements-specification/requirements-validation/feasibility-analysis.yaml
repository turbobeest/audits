description:
  what: |
    This audit examines the feasibility analysis of requirements before
    commitment. It evaluates:
    - Technical feasibility assessment
    - Resource feasibility evaluation
    - Schedule feasibility review
    - Risk identification
    - Constraint analysis
    - Alternative consideration
  why_it_matters: |
    Feasibility analysis prevents commitment to impossible requirements:
    - Some requirements may be technically impossible
    - Resource constraints may make requirements infeasible
    - Schedule constraints affect what's achievable
    - Early feasibility saves wasted effort
    - Identifies need for prototyping or research
    - Enables informed stakeholder decisions
