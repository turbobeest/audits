  what: |
    This audit examines the process for reviewing and validating requirements.
    It evaluates:
    - Review process definition
    - Review participants and roles
    - Review criteria and checklists
    - Review frequency and timing
    - Issue tracking and resolution
    - Review effectiveness metrics
  why_it_matters: |
    Requirements reviews catch defects early and cheaply:
    - Defects found in requirements are 10-100x cheaper to fix than in code
    - Reviews validate stakeholder understanding
    - Reviews catch inconsistencies and ambiguities
    - CMMI VER requires reviews as verification method
    - Review process ensures consistent quality
    - Stakeholder review prevents misunderstandings
