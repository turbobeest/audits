  what: |
    This audit examines the capability to perform change impact analysis
    using requirements traceability. It evaluates:
    - Traceability links sufficient for impact analysis
    - Impact analysis process definition
    - Historical impact analyses documented
    - Dependency visualization capability
    - Ripple effect identification
  why_it_matters: |
    Change impact analysis prevents unintended consequences:
    - Changes ripple through requirements, design, code, and tests
    - Without traceability, impacts are guessed not analyzed
    - Incomplete impact analysis leads to regression defects
    - Resource estimation requires accurate impact scope
    - Stakeholder communication requires impact understanding
    - CMMI REQM requires understanding change impacts

  - id: IMPACT-CRIT-001
    signal: No impact analysis capability
    evidence_indicators:
    - Traceability insufficient for impact analysis
    - No documented impact analysis process
    - Changes made without impact assessment
    remediation: |
      - Establish traceability sufficient for impact analysis
      - Define impact analysis process
      - Require impact analysis for all changes
      - Document impact analysis results
      - Train team on impact analysis
  - id: IMPACT-CRIT-002
    signal: Changes approved without impact analysis
    evidence_indicators:
    - Change records without impact assessment
    - No impact analysis artifacts
    - Impacts discovered during implementation
    remediation: |
      - Require impact analysis before change approval
      - Document all affected artifacts
      - Include effort estimates based on impact
      - Review impact analysis in change approval
  high:
  - id: IMPACT-HIGH-001
    signal: Impact analysis incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only direct impacts identified
    - Ripple effects not considered
    - Test impacts missed
    remediation: |
      - Trace impacts through all artifact types
      - Include ripple effects in analysis
      - Analyze test coverage impacts
      - Document complete impact chain
