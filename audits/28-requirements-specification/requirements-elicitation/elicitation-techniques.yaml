  what: |
    This audit examines the variety and appropriateness of elicitation techniques
    used to gather requirements from stakeholders. It evaluates:
    - Range of elicitation methods employed (interviews, workshops, surveys, etc.)
    - Technique selection based on stakeholder characteristics
    - Documentation of elicitation sessions and outcomes
    - Effectiveness of techniques in capturing tacit knowledge
    - Use of prototyping and visualization for requirement discovery
    - Validation of elicited requirements with stakeholders
  why_it_matters: |
    The choice of elicitation techniques directly impacts requirements quality:
    - IREB identifies elicitation as a core requirements engineering activity
    - Different stakeholders respond better to different techniques
    - Tacit knowledge requires observation-based techniques, not just interviews
    - Over-reliance on single techniques leads to blind spots in requirements
    - IEEE 830 notes that requirements come from many sources requiring varied approaches
    - Poor elicitation leads to 40-60% of defects traced to requirements issues

    Research shows that combining multiple elicitation techniques yields
    significantly more complete requirements than using any single method.
  when_to_run:
  - Before major elicitation activities begin
  - When requirements quality issues are identified
  - During requirements process improvement initiatives
  - After project post-mortems identify requirements gaps
  - When onboarding new requirements engineers

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ELICIT-CRIT-001
    signal: No documented elicitation activities
    evidence_indicators:
    - No interview records found
    - No workshop documentation
    - Requirements appear without documented source
    explanation: |
      Without documented elicitation, requirements provenance is unknown.
      IREB stresses that elicitation must be systematic and documented.
      Undocumented elicitation cannot be validated, repeated, or improved.
      Requirements without traceable elicitation are essentially assumptions.
    remediation: |
      - Establish elicitation documentation standards
      - Record all elicitation sessions (notes, recordings with consent)
      - Link requirements to elicitation sources
      - Create elicitation templates for consistency
      - Train team on elicitation documentation practices
  - id: ELICIT-CRIT-002
    signal: Single elicitation technique used exclusively
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only interviews documented, no other techniques
    - Requirements derived solely from documents
    - No observation or prototyping activities
    explanation: |
      Over-reliance on a single technique leads to blind spots. Different
      techniques excel at different types of requirements. BABOK recommends
      technique selection based on stakeholder characteristics and
      requirement types. Tacit knowledge often requires observation, not interviews.
    remediation: |
      - Assess stakeholder characteristics and select appropriate techniques
      - Add complementary techniques (surveys for broad input, workshops for consensus)
      - Include observation-based techniques for workflow understanding
      - Use prototypes to elicit usability requirements
      - Document rationale for technique selection
  high:
  - id: ELICIT-HIGH-001
    signal: No validation of elicited requirements with stakeholders
    evidence_indicators:
    - Elicitation sessions without follow-up validation
    - No stakeholder sign-off on interpreted requirements
    - Requirements directly transcribed without confirmation
    explanation: |
      Elicited information must be validated with stakeholders to confirm
      accurate interpretation. Without validation, requirements may reflect
      analyst assumptions rather than stakeholder needs. IREB emphasizes
      validation as integral to elicitation, not a separate phase.
    remediation: |
      - Establish validation checkpoints after elicitation
      - Send session summaries to stakeholders for confirmation
      - Use techniques like prototypes for requirement validation
      - Track validation status per requirement
      - Re-elicit when validation identifies misunderstandings
  - id: ELICIT-HIGH-002
    signal: Tacit knowledge not systematically captured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No observation or contextual inquiry performed
    - Requirements miss workflow and process knowledge
    - Users report missing functionality post-deployment
    explanation: |
      Tacit knowledge (what experts know but can't articulate) requires
      observation-based techniques. Interview-only approaches miss this
      critical knowledge. IREB recommends techniques like contextual
      inquiry and ethnographic observation for workflow-intensive systems.
    remediation: |
      - Add observation sessions to elicitation plan
      - Use contextual inquiry (observe users in their environment)
      - Employ think-aloud protocols during task observation
      - Document implicit assumptions and workarounds observed
      - Validate tacit knowledge capture with domain experts
  - id: ELICIT-HIGH-003
    signal: Elicitation limited to happy path scenarios
    evidence_indicators:
    - No exception scenarios elicited
    - Error handling requirements missing
    - Edge cases discovered only during testing
    explanation: |
      Stakeholders often focus on normal scenarios during elicitation.
      Without probing for exceptions, error cases, and edge scenarios,
      requirements remain incomplete. BABOK recommends scenario-based
      techniques that explicitly explore alternative paths.
    remediation: |
      - Include exception scenario probing in interviews
      - Use techniques like "what if" questioning
      - Analyze existing error logs for common exceptions
      - Review support tickets for missing requirements
      - Add negative scenario workshops to elicitation plan
  medium:
  - id: ELICIT-MED-001
    signal: No elicitation technique rationale documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Techniques used without documented selection criteria
    - Inconsistent technique usage across requirements areas
    - No mapping of techniques to stakeholder types
    explanation: |
      Technique selection should be intentional based on stakeholder
      characteristics, requirement types, and constraints. Without
      documented rationale, technique selection becomes ad-hoc and
      improvement is difficult.
    remediation: |
      - Document technique selection criteria
      - Map techniques to stakeholder characteristics
      - Create technique selection guidelines
      - Review technique effectiveness and refine selection criteria
  - id: ELICIT-MED-002
    signal: Elicitation sessions not time-boxed or structured
    evidence_indicators:
    - Variable session durations without planning
    - No agendas for elicitation sessions
    - Sessions frequently run over time or end prematurely
    explanation: |
      Unstructured elicitation is inefficient and may miss important
      topics. IREB recommends structured approaches with clear agendas
      and time management to ensure comprehensive coverage.
    remediation: |
      - Create templates for elicitation session agendas
      - Time-box sessions appropriately
      - Prepare topic lists aligned with requirements areas
      - Train facilitators in session management
  - id: ELICIT-MED-003
    signal: Remote elicitation without adapted techniques
    evidence_indicators:
    - Remote sessions using in-person technique approaches
    - Low engagement in remote elicitation
    - Technical difficulties impacting elicitation quality
    explanation: |
      Remote elicitation requires technique adaptation for effectiveness.
      Simply conducting interviews over video may miss non-verbal cues
      and reduce engagement. Digital collaboration tools enable new
      techniques but require preparation.
    remediation: |
      - Adapt techniques for remote delivery
      - Use digital collaboration tools (Miro, Mural)
      - Pre-send materials for remote sessions
      - Use asynchronous techniques where appropriate
      - Test technology before sessions
  low:
  - id: ELICIT-LOW-001
    signal: Elicitation effectiveness not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No tracking of requirements changes post-elicitation
    - No stakeholder satisfaction feedback
    - No correlation of defects to elicitation gaps
    explanation: |
      Without measuring elicitation effectiveness, technique selection
      cannot be improved. Tracking defects traced to requirements and
      stakeholder satisfaction provides feedback for process improvement.
    remediation: |
      - Track defects by root cause including requirements
      - Collect stakeholder feedback on elicitation process
      - Analyze requirements volatility by elicitation technique
      - Use metrics to refine technique selection
  positive:
  - id: ELICIT-POS-001
    signal: Multiple complementary techniques employed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Interviews combined with workshops and prototypes
    - Technique selection matched to stakeholder needs
    - Both explicit and tacit knowledge capture documented
  - id: ELICIT-POS-002
    signal: Systematic elicitation process followed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Documented elicitation plan with technique rationale
    - Consistent session documentation
    - Validation checkpoints after elicitation
