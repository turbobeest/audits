  what: |
    This audit examines the completeness and accuracy of stakeholder identification
    processes used in requirements elicitation. It evaluates:
    - Stakeholder discovery and mapping techniques
    - Classification of stakeholder types (primary, secondary, tertiary)
    - Identification of decision-makers, influencers, and end users
    - Analysis of stakeholder interests, needs, and constraints
    - Documentation of stakeholder communication preferences
    - Coverage of internal and external stakeholders
  why_it_matters: |
    Proper stakeholder identification is foundational to successful requirements gathering:
    - Missing stakeholders leads to incomplete requirements and project failure
    - IEEE 830 emphasizes the importance of identifying all parties with interests
    - IREB CPRE Foundation Level stresses stakeholder analysis as a core competency
    - Poor stakeholder identification is cited as a top cause of project failure
    - Different stakeholders have conflicting needs requiring explicit management
    - Regulatory stakeholders may impose mandatory requirements

    The Standish Group's CHAOS reports consistently identify incomplete requirements
    and lack of stakeholder involvement as primary causes of project failure.
  when_to_run:
  - Project initiation phase
  - Before requirements elicitation begins
  - When project scope changes significantly
  - During project health assessments
  - When requirements conflicts arise

signals:
  critical:
  - id: STAKE-CRIT-001
    signal: No stakeholder identification performed
    evidence_indicators:
    - No stakeholder register or matrix exists
    - No personas or user types defined
    - Requirements lack attribution to stakeholder groups
    explanation: |
      Without stakeholder identification, requirements elicitation proceeds blindly.
      IREB emphasizes that stakeholder analysis must precede elicitation to ensure
      all relevant perspectives are captured. Missing stakeholders means missing
      requirements, leading to rework, scope creep, or project failure.
    remediation: |
      - Conduct stakeholder identification workshop
      - Create stakeholder register with roles, interests, and influence
      - Map stakeholders to requirements areas
      - Establish communication channels with each stakeholder group
      - Validate stakeholder list with project sponsor
  - id: STAKE-CRIT-002
    signal: End users not identified or represented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No end-user personas defined
    - Requirements focus only on business stakeholders
    - No user research or direct user involvement documented
    explanation: |
      End users are the ultimate consumers of the system. Without their
      representation in requirements, usability suffers and adoption fails.
      BABOK stresses the importance of understanding all beneficiaries of
      the solution, particularly those who will interact with it daily.
    remediation: |
      - Identify primary end-user groups
      - Create detailed user personas
      - Establish channels for user feedback
      - Include user representatives in requirements reviews
      - Plan user research activities (interviews, observations)
  high:
  - id: STAKE-HIGH-001
    signal: Incomplete stakeholder categorization
    evidence_indicators:
    - Stakeholders listed without classification
    - Missing influence/interest analysis
    - No differentiation between decision-makers and information providers
    explanation: |
      Not all stakeholders have equal influence or interest. Without
      categorization (power/interest grid), engagement strategies cannot
      be tailored appropriately, risking disengagement of key stakeholders
      or over-engagement of peripheral ones.
    remediation: |
      - Apply stakeholder classification framework (power/interest matrix)
      - Identify decision-makers vs. consultees vs. informees
      - Document engagement strategy per stakeholder category
      - Review and update classifications as project progresses
  - id: STAKE-HIGH-002
    signal: External stakeholders not considered
    evidence_indicators:
    - Stakeholder list contains only internal parties
    - No regulatory or compliance stakeholders identified
    - Partners, vendors, or customers not represented
    explanation: |
      External stakeholders often impose mandatory requirements (regulations,
      contracts, standards). Missing them leads to compliance failures,
      integration issues, or contractual breaches discovered late in development.
    remediation: |
      - Review all external relationships (vendors, partners, regulators)
      - Identify regulatory bodies and their requirements
      - Include customer representatives
      - Document external stakeholder constraints and expectations
  - id: STAKE-HIGH-003
    signal: Conflicting stakeholder interests not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple stakeholders with overlapping concerns
    - No conflict resolution approach defined
    - Requirements with contradictory statements
    explanation: |
      Stakeholders often have conflicting interests (cost vs. features,
      security vs. usability). Without explicit documentation of conflicts
      and resolution strategies, requirements remain inconsistent and
      decision-making becomes political rather than rational.
    remediation: |
      - Document known conflicts between stakeholder interests
      - Establish conflict resolution process
      - Identify conflict arbitration authority
      - Create priority framework for resolving conflicts
  medium:
  - id: STAKE-MED-001
    signal: Stakeholder contact information not maintained
    evidence_indicators:
    - Stakeholders listed without contact details
    - Outdated contact information
    - No preferred communication channel documented
    explanation: |
      Effective stakeholder engagement requires current contact information
      and communication preferences. Outdated information delays requirements
      clarification and approval processes.
    remediation: |
      - Update stakeholder register with current contacts
      - Document preferred communication channels
      - Establish regular contact information verification
      - Designate backup contacts for key stakeholders
  - id: STAKE-MED-002
    signal: Stakeholder availability constraints not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No availability information for key stakeholders
    - Requirements activities not aligned with stakeholder schedules
    - History of stakeholder unavailability issues
    explanation: |
      Stakeholder availability impacts requirements elicitation scheduling.
      Without documented constraints, workshops and reviews may be scheduled
      when key stakeholders cannot attend, leading to incomplete input or delays.
    remediation: |
      - Document stakeholder availability constraints
      - Identify backup participants for each stakeholder
      - Plan elicitation activities around stakeholder availability
      - Establish asynchronous input mechanisms
  low:
  - id: STAKE-LOW-001
    signal: Stakeholder identification not version controlled
    evidence_indicators:
    - Stakeholder register in uncontrolled document
    - No history of stakeholder changes
    - No audit trail for stakeholder updates
    explanation: |
      Stakeholder landscapes change over time. Without version control,
      it's difficult to understand how stakeholder involvement evolved
      and why certain decisions were made.
    remediation: |
      - Store stakeholder documentation in version control
      - Track changes to stakeholder roles and involvement
      - Maintain history of stakeholder additions and removals
  positive:
  - id: STAKE-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive stakeholder analysis performed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Complete stakeholder register with categorization
    - Power/interest matrix documented
    - Communication plan per stakeholder group
  - id: STAKE-POS-002
    signal: Regular stakeholder engagement maintained
    evidence_indicators:
    - Evidence of ongoing stakeholder communication
    - Stakeholder feedback incorporated in requirements
    - Regular stakeholder review meetings documented
