  what: |
    This audit examines the planning, execution, and outcomes of requirements
    workshops (JAD sessions, story mapping workshops, etc.). It evaluates:
    - Workshop planning and preparation quality
    - Participant selection and attendance
    - Facilitation effectiveness
    - Workshop output documentation
    - Follow-up action tracking
    - Conflict resolution during workshops
  why_it_matters: |
    Requirements workshops are high-value, high-cost elicitation activities:
    - JAD (Joint Application Development) sessions accelerate consensus building
    - Workshops enable real-time conflict resolution among stakeholders
    - BABOK identifies workshops as primary technique for complex requirements
    - Poor workshop execution wastes stakeholder time and damages credibility
    - Effective workshops can compress weeks of interviews into days
    - Workshop outcomes require skilled facilitation to be actionable

    Studies show that well-facilitated workshops achieve 3-5x the requirements
    throughput of equivalent interview time while building stakeholder consensus.
  when_to_run:
  - Before major workshop planning
  - After workshop completion for retrospective
  - When workshop effectiveness concerns arise
  - During requirements process improvement
  - When scaling requirements activities

signals:
  critical:
  - id: WKSHP-CRIT-001
    signal: Workshops conducted without documented outcomes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Workshop invitations exist but no output documentation
    - Stakeholder time invested without captured requirements
    - No action items from workshop sessions
    explanation: |
      Workshops are expensive (multiple stakeholders' time). Without documented
      outcomes, this investment is wasted. BABOK emphasizes that workshop value
      comes from captured, validated outputs that feed requirements documentation.
      Undocumented workshops must often be repeated.
    remediation: |
      - Establish workshop documentation standards
      - Assign dedicated scribes for all workshops
      - Use visual artifacts (photos of whiteboards, digital boards)
      - Create standardized workshop output templates
      - Distribute summaries within 24 hours of workshop
  - id: WKSHP-CRIT-002
    signal: Key stakeholders absent from requirements workshops
    evidence_indicators:
    - Decision-makers not present for scope decisions
    - End users absent from usability discussions
    - Technical constraints not represented in feasibility workshops
    explanation: |
      Workshop effectiveness depends on having the right participants.
      Missing key stakeholders means decisions lack authority or technical
      grounding. JAD methodology specifically requires sponsor commitment
      to stakeholder participation.
    remediation: |
      - Ensure stakeholder availability before scheduling
      - Obtain management commitment for key participant attendance
      - Use stakeholder analysis to identify required participants
      - Have backup participants identified for critical roles
      - Reschedule rather than proceed without key stakeholders
  high:
  - id: WKSHP-HIGH-001
    signal: No workshop facilitation approach
    evidence_indicators:
    - Workshops run by subject matter experts, not facilitators
    - No neutral facilitation documented
    - Workshop dominated by single stakeholder
    explanation: |
      Effective workshops require skilled facilitation. Without neutral
      facilitation, workshops become dominated by the loudest voices or
      highest-ranking participants. BABOK emphasizes the business analyst's
      role as neutral facilitator in workshops.
    remediation: |
      - Assign trained facilitators to workshops
      - Separate facilitator role from content contribution
      - Train facilitators in workshop techniques
      - Use facilitation techniques to ensure balanced participation
      - Document facilitation approach in workshop plans
  - id: WKSHP-HIGH-002
    signal: Workshop preparation inadequate
    evidence_indicators:
    - No pre-work distributed to participants
    - Workshop objectives unclear to participants
    - Background materials not provided in advance
    explanation: |
      Workshop time is expensive. Without preparation, time is wasted
      on context-setting that could be done asynchronously. JAD methodology
      requires significant pre-workshop preparation including pre-interviews
      and material distribution.
    remediation: |
      - Create workshop preparation checklists
      - Distribute pre-reading and pre-work with clear deadlines
      - Conduct pre-workshop interviews for complex topics
      - Send clear objectives and agendas in advance
      - Confirm participant preparation before workshop
  - id: WKSHP-HIGH-003
    signal: Workshop action items not tracked to completion
    evidence_indicators:
    - Action items assigned but not followed up
    - Open items from multiple workshops unresolved
    - No accountability for workshop action items
    explanation: |
      Workshops often identify items needing follow-up. Without tracking,
      these items are lost, undermining workshop value. Action item
      closure is essential for workshop credibility and requirements completeness.
    remediation: |
      - Establish action item tracking system
      - Assign owners and due dates to all action items
      - Review action item status in subsequent sessions
      - Escalate overdue items appropriately
      - Close workshop cycles when all actions resolved
  medium:
  - id: WKSHP-MED-001
    signal: Workshop duration not matched to objectives
    evidence_indicators:
    - Short workshops for complex topics
    - Extended workshops losing participant engagement
    - Objectives not completed within scheduled time
    explanation: |
      Workshop duration must match scope. Too short leads to incomplete
      outcomes; too long causes fatigue and disengagement. BABOK recommends
      aligning duration with complexity and participant capacity.
    remediation: |
      - Estimate workshop duration based on objectives
      - Plan breaks for sessions over 90 minutes
      - Split complex topics across multiple sessions
      - Build in buffer time for discussions
      - End early rather than forcing fatigued completion
  - id: WKSHP-MED-002
    signal: Remote workshops not adapted for format
    evidence_indicators:
    - Virtual workshops using in-person techniques
    - Low engagement in remote sessions
    - Technical difficulties disrupting workshops
    explanation: |
      Remote workshops require format adaptation. In-person techniques
      don't translate directly. Digital facilitation tools and engagement
      techniques are needed for effective remote workshops.
    remediation: |
      - Use digital collaboration tools (Miro, Mural)
      - Adapt exercises for remote participation
      - Plan shorter sessions with more breaks
      - Test technology before workshop
      - Use engagement techniques (polls, reactions, breakouts)
  - id: WKSHP-MED-003
    signal: Workshop conflicts unresolved
    evidence_indicators:
    - Conflicting requirements captured without resolution
    - Stakeholder disagreements documented as open issues
    - No conflict resolution mechanism in workshops
    explanation: |
      A key workshop benefit is real-time conflict resolution. Without
      resolution mechanisms, workshops merely surface conflicts without
      resolving them, deferring difficult decisions.
    remediation: |
      - Include conflict resolution in facilitation training
      - Use voting or prioritization techniques for deadlocks
      - Escalate unresolved conflicts with documented positions
      - Involve sponsors for authoritative decisions
      - Document minority positions for future reference
  low:
  - id: WKSHP-LOW-001
    signal: Workshop retrospectives not conducted
    evidence_indicators:
    - No feedback collected on workshop effectiveness
    - Same issues recurring across workshops
    - No workshop process improvement
    explanation: |
      Without retrospectives, workshop facilitation cannot improve.
      Participant feedback identifies issues with format, preparation,
      or facilitation that can be addressed in future sessions.
    remediation: |
      - Conduct brief retrospective after each workshop
      - Collect participant feedback
      - Track improvement actions from retrospectives
      - Share lessons learned across facilitation team
  positive:
  - id: WKSHP-POS-001
    signal: Well-structured workshop process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear preparation, execution, and follow-up phases
    - Documented facilitation approach
    - Action items tracked to completion
  - id: WKSHP-POS-002
    signal: Effective stakeholder engagement in workshops
    evidence_indicators:
    - High attendance rates
    - Balanced participation documented
    - Conflicts resolved during sessions
