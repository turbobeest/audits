description:
  what: |
    This audit examines the process for assessing impact of requirements
    changes before approval. It evaluates:
    - Impact assessment process
    - Scope of assessment (schedule, cost, other requirements)
    - Assessment quality and completeness
    - Stakeholder involvement
    - Documentation of impacts
    - Use in decision-making
  why_it_matters: |
    Impact assessment enables informed decisions:
    - Changes have ripple effects
    - Cost/schedule impacts must be known before approval
    - Other requirements may be affected
    - Risk implications must be understood
    - Stakeholders need impact information
    - CMMI REQM requires impact understanding

    signal: Changes approved without impact assessment
    evidence_indicators:
    - No impact documentation
    - Approval without understanding consequences
    - Impact discovered after implementation
    remediation: |
      - Require impact assessment for all changes
      - Define assessment scope
      - Document all impacts
      - Include in approval decision
  - id: IMPACT-CRIT-002
    signal: Impact assessment incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only direct impacts considered
    - Schedule/cost impacts missing
    - Related requirements not checked
    remediation: |
      - Define comprehensive assessment scope
      - Include schedule and cost
      - Assess related requirements
      - Evaluate risks
      - Document all impacts
  high:
  - id: IMPACT-HIGH-001
    signal: Traceability not used in impact analysis
    evidence_indicators:
    - Impact analysis without traceability
    - Related artifacts not identified
    - Incomplete impact discovery
    remediation: |
      - Use traceability for impact analysis
      - Follow all trace links
      - Identify affected artifacts
      - Document impact chain
