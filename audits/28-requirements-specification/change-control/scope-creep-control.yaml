  what: |
    This audit examines measures to prevent and control scope creep.
    It evaluates:
    - Scope definition clarity
    - Change process enforcement
    - Scope monitoring mechanisms
    - Scope creep detection
    - Corrective actions
    - Stakeholder communication about scope
  why_it_matters: |
    Scope creep is a leading cause of project failure:
    - Uncontrolled scope expansion exhausts resources
    - Small changes accumulate to major scope increase
    - Schedule and budget overruns follow
    - Original objectives may be compromised
    - Team morale suffers from moving goalposts
    - Proactive control prevents escalation

    evidence_indicators:
    - No scope definition
    - In/out of scope unclear
    - No scope baseline
    remediation: |
      - Define scope clearly
      - Document in-scope items

    - Resources/schedule not adjusted
    remediation: |
      - Enforce change process
      - Assess scope status
      - Communicate expansion
      - Adjust plan or reduce scope

    remediation: |
      - Implement scope monitoring
      - Track requirement changes
      - Report scope status
      - Alert on significant changes
