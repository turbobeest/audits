description:
  what: |
    Comprehensive evaluation of supplier continuity practices including
    critical supplier identification, dependency analysis, contingency
    planning, alternative supplier identification, and recovery procedures.
    Reviews whether the organization can maintain operations despite
    supplier disruptions or failures.

  why_it_matters: |
    Supplier disruptions can halt critical business operations, delay
    projects, and cause financial losses. Single points of failure in
    the supply chain create significant risk. Effective supplier continuity
    planning ensures resilience against vendor outages, financial failures,
    natural disasters, or geopolitical events affecting suppliers.

  when_to_run:
    - "Annual business continuity planning"
    - "When onboarding critical suppliers"
    - "After supplier disruption events"
    - "During strategic vendor reviews"
    - "When expanding into new markets"

        - "Critical dependency with no alternative"
        - "No contingency plan for supplier failure"
        - "Single point of failure in supply chain"
      explanation: |
        Single-source critical suppliers without contingencies create
        unacceptable operational risk. Supplier failure could halt
        operations with no recovery path.
      remediation: "Develop contingency plans and identify alternatives"

        - "Dependencies unknown"
      explanation: |
        Without knowing which suppliers are critical, organizations
        cannot prioritize continuity planning or manage concentration risk.
      remediation: "Identify and document critical suppliers"
