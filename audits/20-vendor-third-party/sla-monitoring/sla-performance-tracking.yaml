description:
  what: |
    Evaluates SLA performance tracking including:
    - Performance measurement systems
    - Data collection accuracy
    - Metric calculation methodologies
    - Reporting timeliness and accuracy
    - Trend analysis capabilities
    - Performance baseline management
    - Alert and threshold monitoring
    - Historical performance analysis
    - Vendor performance comparison

  why_it_matters: |
    Effective SLA tracking enables vendor accountability.
    Poor performance tracking results in:
    - Undetected vendor underperformance
    - Inability to enforce SLA remedies
    - Disputed performance measurements
    - Reactive rather than proactive management
    - Inability to identify degradation trends
    - Loss of service credits
    - Uninformed contract decisions
    Robust tracking enables evidence-based vendor management.

  when_to_run:
    - "Quarterly vendor reviews"
    - "After SLA measurement disputes"
    - "During vendor performance audits"
    - "When implementing new monitoring"
    - "Annual vendor management reviews"

      evidence_indicators:
        - "Critical vendor with no monitoring"
        - "Performance data not collected"
        - "No visibility into service levels"
      explanation: |
        Without tracking, SLA compliance cannot be verified.
        Critical vendor performance must be continuously monitored.
      remediation: "Implement comprehensive SLA tracking for all critical vendors"

    - id: "SPT-CRIT-002"
      signal: "Measurement data unreliable or inaccurate"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Measurement gaps or inconsistencies"
        - "Data collection failures"
        - "Calculations differ from vendor reports"
      explanation: |
        Unreliable data makes SLA enforcement impossible and
        creates disputes over actual performance.
      remediation: "Implement validated, reliable measurement systems"

    - id: "SPT-CRIT-003"

        - "Breaches discovered after the fact"
        - "No proactive notifications"
        - "No threshold monitoring"
      explanation: |
        Without alerts, SLA breaches go unnoticed until
        significant impact has occurred.
      remediation: "Implement real-time SLA threshold alerting"
