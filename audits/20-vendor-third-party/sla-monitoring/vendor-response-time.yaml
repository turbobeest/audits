  what: |
    Evaluates vendor response time tracking including:
    - Support response time SLAs
    - API/service latency requirements
    - Incident response commitments
    - Escalation response times
    - Communication response requirements
    - Time-to-resolution tracking
    - Response time measurement accuracy
    - Priority-based response requirements
    - After-hours response commitments

  why_it_matters: |
    Response time impacts operational effectiveness and user experience.
    Poor response time tracking results in:
    - Undetected slow vendor responses
    - Missed support SLAs
    - Extended incident resolution
    - Degraded user experience
    - Business process delays
    - Inability to enforce response commitments
    - Uninformed vendor selection decisions
    Accurate response tracking ensures vendor accountability.

  when_to_run:
    - "Quarterly vendor reviews"
    - "After response time complaints"
    - "During vendor performance evaluations"
    - "When establishing new vendor relationships"
    - "Annual SLA reviews"

        - "Response times exceed SLA thresholds"
        - "Pattern of slow responses"
        - "Critical priority responses delayed"
      explanation: |
        Consistent SLA misses indicate vendor capacity or
        commitment issues requiring immediate attention.
      remediation: "Escalate to vendor management and enforce remediation"

    - id: "VRT-CRIT-002"
      signal: "No response time tracking for critical vendor"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Response times not measured"
        - "No visibility into support performance"
        - "Relying on vendor self-reporting only"
      explanation: |
        Without tracking, response performance cannot be verified
        and SLA compliance cannot be enforced.

      explanation: |
        Critical incident response directly impacts business
        operations and requires strict adherence.
      remediation: "Enforce critical response requirements or escalate"

  high:
