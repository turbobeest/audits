description:
  what: |
    Evaluates SLA breach handling processes including:
    - Breach detection mechanisms
    - Escalation procedures
    - Root cause analysis requirements
    - Remediation tracking
    - Service credit calculation
    - Credit claim processes
    - Vendor communication protocols
    - Breach pattern analysis
    - Contract enforcement actions
    - Documentation requirements

  why_it_matters: |
    Effective breach handling ensures SLA accountability.
    Poor breach handling results in:
    - Unclaimed service credits
    - Repeated breaches without improvement
    - Vendor relationship deterioration
    - Inadequate remediation
    - Unresolved performance issues
    - Loss of negotiating leverage
    - Business impact without recourse
    Structured breach handling protects organizational interests.

  when_to_run:
    - "After significant SLA breaches"
    - "Quarterly vendor reviews"
    - "During process improvement initiatives"
    - "When breach patterns emerge"
    - "Annual vendor management assessments"

signals:
  critical:
    - id: "SBH-CRIT-001"
      signal: "No formal breach handling process"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Breaches handled ad-hoc"
        - "No documented procedures"
        - "Inconsistent responses to breaches"
      explanation: |
        Without formal processes, breaches are inconsistently
        handled and accountability is lost.
      remediation: "Implement formal SLA breach handling procedures"

    - id: "SBH-CRIT-002"
      signal: "Breaches not detected or reported"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Breaches discovered long after occurrence"
        - "No detection mechanisms"
        - "Breaches unreported to vendor"
      explanation: |
        Undetected breaches cannot be remediated and service
        credits cannot be claimed.
      remediation: "Implement breach detection and reporting mechanisms"

    - id: "SBH-CRIT-003"
      signal: "Service credits not claimed"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Credits available but not claimed"
        - "No credit tracking system"
        - "Claim deadlines missed"
      explanation: |
        Unclaimed credits represent financial loss and reduce
        vendor accountability.
      remediation: "Implement systematic service credit tracking and claims"
