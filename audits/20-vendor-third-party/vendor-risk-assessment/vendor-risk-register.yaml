description:
  what: |
    Comprehensive evaluation of the vendor risk register including completeness,
    accuracy, risk categorization, risk treatment tracking, ownership assignment,
    and integration with enterprise risk management. Reviews whether vendor risks
    are systematically identified, documented, and managed.

  why_it_matters: |
    The vendor risk register is the central repository for tracking vendor-related
    risks. An incomplete or inaccurate register means risks are unmanaged and
    potentially forgotten. Proper register maintenance enables risk prioritization,
    resource allocation, and executive visibility into third-party risk exposure.

  when_to_run:
    - "Annual vendor risk program review"
    - "During internal audits"
    - "Before board risk reporting"
    - "After vendor security incidents"
    - "During regulatory examinations"

        - "Vendor risks not centrally tracked"
        - "No risk documentation system"
        - "Risks managed ad hoc"
      explanation: |
        Without a risk register, vendor risks are invisible and unmanaged.
        Organizations cannot demonstrate risk oversight or make informed
        risk decisions.
      remediation: "Implement comprehensive vendor risk register"

      evidence_indicators:
        - "Known high risks not documented"
        - "Register incomplete for critical vendors"
        - "Gap between known and registered risks"
      explanation: |
        Unregistered critical risks are effectively unmanaged and may
        be forgotten, leading to unmitigated exposure.
      remediation: "Review and add all critical vendor risks to register"

      explanation: "Unowned risks have no accountability"
      remediation: "Assign owner to every registered risk"

    - id: "VRR-HIGH-003"
