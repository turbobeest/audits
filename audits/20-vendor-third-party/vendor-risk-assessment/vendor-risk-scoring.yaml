description:
  what: |
    Comprehensive evaluation of vendor risk scoring methodology including
    scoring models, risk factor weighting, inherent vs. residual risk
    calculations, score aggregation methods, and score accuracy validation.
    Reviews whether risk scores accurately reflect vendor risk profiles and
    inform appropriate management decisions.

  why_it_matters: |
    Vendor risk scores drive critical decisions about vendor approval, control
    requirements, monitoring intensity, and risk acceptance. Inaccurate scores
    lead to misallocated resources, overlooked high-risk vendors, or excessive
    burden on low-risk relationships. Robust scoring enables risk-informed
    vendor management at scale.

  when_to_run:
    - "Annual vendor management program review"
    - "When updating scoring methodology"
    - "After vendor security incidents"
    - "During program effectiveness assessments"
    - "When onboarding scoring tools"

        - "Vendors not assigned risk scores"
        - "No quantitative risk assessment"
        - "Risk decisions based on intuition"
      explanation: |
        Without risk scoring, organizations cannot objectively compare
        vendor risks or make consistent risk-informed decisions.
        Subjective assessments are unreliable and inconsistent.
      remediation: "Develop and implement vendor risk scoring methodology"

    - id: "VRS-CRIT-002"
      signal: "Risk scores significantly inaccurate"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "High-risk vendors scored low"
        - "Score calculations contain errors"
        - "Scores inconsistent with actual risk"
      explanation: |
        Inaccurate risk scores lead to incorrect control requirements
        and monitoring levels, potentially exposing the organization
        to unmanaged vendor risk.
