description:
  what: |
    Comprehensive evaluation of vendor reputation assessment processes including
    media monitoring, litigation history, regulatory actions, customer feedback,
    industry standing, and reputational risk indicators. Reviews whether
    reputational risks are appropriately evaluated before and during vendor
    relationships.

  why_it_matters: |
    Vendor reputational issues can create significant organizational exposure
    through association. Vendors involved in scandals, breaches, ethical
    violations, or regulatory enforcement actions can damage customer trust
    and brand value. Proactive reputation monitoring enables informed decisions
    and early issue detection.

  when_to_run:
    - "During vendor onboarding"
    - "Annual vendor review cycles"
    - "When reputational concerns surface"
    - "Before contract renewals"
    - "After industry incidents"
