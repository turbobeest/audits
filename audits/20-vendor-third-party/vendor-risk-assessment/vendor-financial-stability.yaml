description:
  what: |
    Comprehensive evaluation of vendor financial stability assessment processes
    including financial health indicators, credit ratings, market stability,
    financial statement analysis, and ongoing monitoring. Reviews whether
    financial risk is appropriately evaluated and monitored for critical vendors.

  why_it_matters: |
    Vendor financial instability can lead to service disruption, data loss,
    or sudden termination of critical services. Financially distressed vendors
    may cut security investments, lose key staff, or cease operations without
    notice. Proactive financial monitoring enables contingency planning and
    reduces dependency risks.

  when_to_run:
    - "During vendor onboarding for critical vendors"
    - "Annual vendor review cycles"
    - "When financial warning signs appear"
    - "During market volatility periods"
    - "Before contract renewals"
