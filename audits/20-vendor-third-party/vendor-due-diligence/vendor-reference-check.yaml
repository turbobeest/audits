description:
  what: |
    Comprehensive evaluation of vendor reference checking processes including
    reference collection, verification of reference authenticity, structured
    inquiry methods, and reference analysis. Reviews whether reference checks
    effectively validate vendor claims and identify potential concerns.

  why_it_matters: |
    References provide third-party validation of vendor capabilities,
    reliability, and service quality. Without proper reference checks,
    organizations rely solely on vendor self-representation. Structured
    reference checking reveals real-world performance, potential issues,
    and validates vendor claims.

  when_to_run:
    - "During vendor selection process"
    - "Before critical vendor contracts"
    - "When evaluating new service offerings"
    - "During vendor performance reviews"
    - "When concerns arise about vendor performance"

signals:
  critical:
    - id: "VRC-CRIT-001"
      signal: "No reference checks performed for critical vendors"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Critical vendors engaged without references"
        - "No reference check process"
        - "References not required"
      explanation: |
        Engaging critical vendors without references relies entirely on
        vendor claims, risking engagement of unqualified vendors.
      remediation: "Implement reference checks for critical vendors"

    - id: "VRC-CRIT-002"
      signal: "References reveal significant concerns ignored"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Negative references not investigated"
        - "Red flags dismissed without documentation"
        - "Vendors engaged despite poor references"
      explanation: |
        Ignoring reference concerns defeats the purpose of reference
        checks and may lead to problematic vendor relationships.
      remediation: "Investigate and document all reference concerns"
