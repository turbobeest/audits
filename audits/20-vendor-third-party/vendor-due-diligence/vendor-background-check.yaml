description:
  what: |
    Comprehensive evaluation of vendor background check processes including
    ownership verification, business registration validation, key personnel
    checks, sanctions screening, adverse media searches, and criminal history
    reviews. Assesses whether due diligence adequately identifies potential
    risks before vendor engagement.

  why_it_matters: |
    Engaging with vendors without proper background checks can expose
    organizations to fraud, regulatory violations, reputational damage, and
    security risks. Vendors may misrepresent capabilities, have undisclosed
    ownership by sanctioned parties, or employ individuals with concerning
    histories. Thorough background checks prevent costly mistakes.

  when_to_run:
    - "Before onboarding new vendors"
    - "Annual high-risk vendor reviews"
    - "When vendor ownership changes"
    - "After red flags emerge"
    - "During regulatory examinations"
