description:
  what: |
    Comprehensive evaluation of vendor capability assessment processes
    including technical capability validation, operational capacity review,
    scalability assessment, expertise verification, and resource adequacy.
    Reviews whether vendors can actually deliver contracted services at
    required quality and scale.

  why_it_matters: |
    Vendors may overstate capabilities to win contracts, leading to
    delivery failures, quality issues, and project delays. Proper
    capability assessment ensures vendors can meet requirements before
    engagement, preventing costly failures and relationship breakdowns.
    Capability validation is especially critical for technical and
    specialized services.

  when_to_run:
    - "During vendor selection process"
    - "Before critical service contracts"
    - "When expanding vendor scope"
    - "During vendor performance reviews"
    - "When technical requirements change"

      evidence_indicators:
        - "Vendors engaged without capability review"
        - "No assessment process exists"
        - "Capabilities assumed without validation"
      explanation: |
        Engaging vendors without capability assessment risks
        selecting vendors who cannot deliver, causing project failures.
      remediation: "Implement capability assessment for all critical vendors"

    - id: "VCA-CRIT-002"

      evidence_indicators:
        - "Known capability gaps not addressed"
        - "Vendor selected despite failing assessment"
        - "Critical requirements unmet"
      explanation: |
        Engaging vendors with known capability gaps creates high
        risk of delivery failure and quality issues.
