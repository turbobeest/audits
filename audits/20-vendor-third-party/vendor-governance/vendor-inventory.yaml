  what: |
    Evaluates vendor inventory including:
    - Inventory completeness
    - Vendor identification and classification
    - Data captured for each vendor
    - Risk categorization
    - Contract linkage
    - Owner assignment
    - Service mapping
    - Contact information
    - Inventory maintenance processes
    - System capabilities

  why_it_matters: |
    Vendor inventory is the foundation of vendor management.
    Incomplete inventory results in:
    - Unknown vendor relationships
    - Unmanaged vendor risks
    - Compliance gaps from missing vendors
    - Ineffective vendor oversight
    - Audit findings
    - Shadow IT vendors
    - Duplicate vendor relationships
    - Inability to assess vendor landscape
    Complete inventory enables effective vendor management.

  when_to_run:
    - "Annual vendor management assessments"
    - "During inventory implementation"
    - "After organizational changes"
    - "During audit preparation"
    - "When vendor landscape changes"

signals:
  critical:
    - id: "VI-CRIT-001"

      evidence_indicators:
        - "No inventory system exists"
        - "Vendor data scattered"
        - "Cannot identify all vendors"
      explanation: |
        Without inventory, vendor landscape is unknown and
        cannot be managed. Inventory is foundational.
      remediation: "Implement centralized vendor inventory"

    - id: "VI-CRIT-002"
      signal: "Significant vendors missing from inventory"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Active vendors not recorded"
        - "Reconciliation shows gaps"
        - "Shadow vendors identified"
      explanation: |
        Missing vendors are unmanaged and create compliance
        and risk gaps.
      remediation: "Complete inventory reconciliation and add missing vendors"

    - id: "VI-CRIT-003"
      signal: "Critical vendors not identified"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "No criticality classification"
        - "Critical vendors unknown"
        - "All vendors treated equally"
      explanation: |
        Critical vendors require enhanced management. Unknown
        criticality prevents appropriate oversight.
      remediation: "Implement criticality classification for all vendors"
