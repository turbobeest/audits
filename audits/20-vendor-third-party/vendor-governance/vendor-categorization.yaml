  what: |
    Evaluates vendor categorization including:
    - Categorization criteria and methodology
    - Risk-based tiering approach
    - Criticality assessment factors
    - Data access classification
    - Service impact evaluation
    - Financial significance thresholds
    - Regulatory applicability
    - Categorization consistency
    - Re-categorization triggers
    - Category-based requirements

  why_it_matters: |
    Categorization enables risk-based vendor management.
    Poor categorization results in:
    - Over-management of low-risk vendors
    - Under-management of high-risk vendors
    - Inconsistent vendor treatment
    - Inefficient resource allocation
    - Regulatory non-compliance
    - Missed critical vendor risks
    - Audit findings
    - Inappropriate control requirements
    Effective categorization focuses effort where risk is highest.

  when_to_run:
    - "When implementing categorization"
    - "Annual methodology reviews"
    - "After vendor landscape changes"
    - "During audit preparation"
    - "When regulations change"

        - "All vendors treated equally"
        - "No risk-based classification"
        - "No categorization criteria"
      explanation: |
        Without categorization, vendor management cannot be
        risk-based and resources are misallocated.
      remediation: "Develop risk-based categorization methodology"

    - id: "VC-CRIT-002"
      signal: "Critical vendors not identified"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "No critical category exists"
        - "High-risk vendors not flagged"
        - "Critical vendors receive standard treatment"
      explanation: |
        Critical vendors require enhanced oversight. Failure
        to identify them creates unmanaged risk.
      remediation: "Identify and appropriately categorize critical vendors"

    - id: "VC-CRIT-003"
      signal: "Categorization criteria do not include key risk factors"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Data access not considered"
        - "Service criticality ignored"
        - "Financial exposure not factored"
      explanation: |
        Categorization must reflect actual risk factors to
        enable appropriate management.
      remediation: "Update criteria to include all relevant risk factors"

  high:
    - id: "VC-HIGH-001"
