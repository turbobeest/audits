  what: |
    Evaluates vendor management policy including:
    - Policy scope and applicability
    - Roles and responsibilities
    - Risk-based categorization requirements
    - Due diligence requirements
    - Contract standards
    - Ongoing monitoring requirements
    - Termination and exit requirements
    - Compliance and reporting
    - Exception processes
    - Policy maintenance and review

  why_it_matters: |
    Policy establishes the foundation for vendor management.
    Weak vendor management policy results in:
    - Inconsistent vendor practices
    - Unclear accountability
    - Gaps in vendor oversight
    - Compliance failures
    - Unmanaged vendor risks
    - Audit findings
    - Regulatory enforcement
    - Inefficient vendor processes
    Strong policy enables consistent, effective vendor management.
