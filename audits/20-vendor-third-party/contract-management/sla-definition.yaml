  what: |
    Evaluates SLA definitions for completeness and enforceability:
    - Service level metrics and measurements
    - Performance thresholds and targets
    - Measurement methodologies
    - Reporting requirements
    - Service credits and remedies
    - Exclusions and exceptions
    - Escalation procedures
    - Review and adjustment mechanisms
    - Alignment with business requirements

  why_it_matters: |
    Well-defined SLAs establish clear expectations and accountability.
    Poor SLA definitions result in:
    - Inability to measure vendor performance
    - Disputes over service levels
    - No recourse for poor performance
    - Misalignment with business needs
    - Unenforceable performance requirements
    - Hidden service degradation
    - Difficulty comparing vendor proposals
    Clear SLAs enable effective vendor management.

  when_to_run:
    - "During contract negotiation"
    - "Annual SLA reviews"
    - "After service level incidents"
    - "When business requirements change"
    - "During vendor performance reviews"

signals:
  critical:
    - id: "SLD-CRIT-001"
      signal: "No SLAs defined for critical services"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Critical vendor with no service levels"
        - "Performance expectations not documented"
        - "No measurement or accountability"
      explanation: |
        Without defined SLAs, vendor performance cannot be measured
        or managed. Critical services require clear service levels.
      remediation: "Define comprehensive SLAs for all critical vendors"

    - id: "SLD-CRIT-002"
      signal: "SLA metrics cannot be measured"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Subjective or vague metrics"
        - "No measurement methodology"
        - "Data not available for measurement"
      explanation: |
        Unmeasurable SLAs are unenforceable. Metrics must be
        objectively measurable to be meaningful.
      remediation: "Define measurable metrics with clear methodology"

    - id: "SLD-CRIT-003"
      signal: "SLAs misaligned with business requirements"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Business needs not reflected in SLAs"
        - "Critical processes not covered"
        - "Thresholds below business requirements"
      explanation: |
        SLAs must align with business needs. Misaligned SLAs
        provide false assurance while risks remain.
      remediation: "Realign SLAs with documented business requirements"

  high:
    - id: "SLD-HIGH-001"
      signal: "No service credits or remedies defined"
      explanation: "Without remedies, SLA breaches have no consequences"
