  what: |
    Evaluates vendor contracts for completeness and adequacy including:
    - Contract structure and clarity
    - Scope of services definition
    - Pricing and payment terms
    - Performance requirements
    - Security and privacy obligations
    - Intellectual property provisions
    - Liability and indemnification
    - Termination and transition provisions
    - Dispute resolution mechanisms
    - Compliance with organizational procurement policies

  why_it_matters: |
    Vendor contracts define the legal and operational framework for
    third-party relationships. Inadequate contracts result in:
    - Unclear responsibilities and expectations
    - Exposure to operational and financial risk
    - Limited recourse for vendor failures
    - Compliance gaps in vendor relationships
    - Difficulty enforcing performance requirements
    - Unexpected costs and scope changes
    - Challenges during vendor transitions
    Thorough contract review protects organizational interests.

  when_to_run:
    - "Before signing new vendor contracts"
    - "During annual vendor reviews"
    - "When renewing or amending contracts"
    - "After significant vendor incidents"
    - "During procurement policy updates"

        - "No termination provisions"
      explanation: |
        Essential contract terms are required for enforceable agreements.
