  what: |
    Evaluates termination provisions in vendor contracts including:
    - Termination for convenience rights
    - Termination for cause provisions
    - Notice periods and requirements
    - Cure periods for breaches
    - Transition assistance obligations
    - Data return and destruction
    - Post-termination access
    - Survival of obligations
    - Wind-down procedures
    - Exit fees and penalties

  why_it_matters: |
    Termination provisions enable orderly vendor transitions.
    Inadequate termination clauses result in:
    - Vendor lock-in and dependency
    - Costly and disruptive transitions
    - Data held hostage by departing vendors
    - Inability to terminate for poor performance
    - Unexpected exit costs
    - Service gaps during transitions
    - Loss of intellectual property or data
    Strong termination provisions protect business continuity.

  when_to_run:
    - "During contract negotiation"
    - "Annual vendor reviews"
    - "Before vendor transitions"
    - "When evaluating vendor dependencies"
    - "During business continuity planning"

signals:
  critical:

      signal: "No termination for convenience right"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Cannot terminate without cause"
        - "Locked into contract term"
        - "No exit except for breach"
      explanation: |
        Without termination for convenience, organization cannot
        exit relationship even when strategically necessary.
      remediation: "Negotiate termination for convenience rights"

    - id: "TC-CRIT-002"
      signal: "No transition assistance obligation"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "No obligation to assist in transition"
        - "No knowledge transfer requirements"
        - "No wind-down period"
      explanation: |
        Without transition assistance, vendor exits create
        significant operational disruption and knowledge loss.
      remediation: "Include transition assistance requirements"

    - id: "TC-CRIT-003"
      signal: "Data return/destruction not specified"

        - "No destruction certification required"
      explanation: |
        Organizational data must be returned or destroyed at
        termination. Unaddressed data creates ongoing risk.
      remediation: "Add data return and destruction requirements"

  high:
    - id: "TC-HIGH-001"
