  what: |
    Evaluates data ownership clauses in vendor contracts including:
    - Data ownership definitions
    - Organizational data rights
    - Vendor data use restrictions
    - Derivative data and insights
    - Aggregated and anonymized data
    - Data portability rights
    - Data retention limits
    - Data deletion obligations
    - Cross-border data considerations
    - Intellectual property in data

  why_it_matters: |
    Clear data ownership protects organizational data assets.
    Unclear data ownership results in:
    - Loss of control over organizational data
    - Vendor claims to organizational data
    - Unauthorized data monetization
    - Inability to migrate data
    - Compliance violations for data handling
    - Intellectual property disputes
    - Data held hostage during transitions
    Clear data ownership clauses preserve data rights.

  when_to_run:
    - "During vendor onboarding"
    - "Before data sharing with vendors"
    - "Annual contract reviews"
    - "When data regulatory requirements change"
    - "Before vendor transitions"

        - "Contract grants vendor ownership"
        - "Vendor retains data rights"
        - "Organization loses data control"
      explanation: |
        Organizational data must remain organizational property.
        Vendor ownership claims expose data assets to loss.
      remediation: "Negotiate clear organizational ownership of data"

    - id: "DOC-CRIT-002"
      signal: "No restrictions on vendor data use"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Vendor can use data for any purpose"
        - "No limits on data monetization"
        - "Vendor can share data freely"
      explanation: |
        Unrestricted vendor data use creates compliance and
        competitive risks from data misuse.
      remediation: "Add clear restrictions on vendor data use"

    - id: "DOC-CRIT-003"

        - "Data held hostage during exit"
      explanation: |
        Without data portability, organization may lose access
        to data during vendor transitions.
      remediation: "Require data portability in standard formats"

  high:
