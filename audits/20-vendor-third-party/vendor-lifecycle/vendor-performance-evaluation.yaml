  what: |
    Evaluates vendor performance evaluation including:
    - Evaluation criteria and metrics
    - Balanced scorecard approach
    - SLA performance weighting
    - Quality assessment methods
    - Cost performance analysis
    - Innovation and value-add evaluation
    - Risk performance assessment
    - Stakeholder input gathering
    - Evaluation consistency
    - Performance improvement actions

  why_it_matters: |
    Performance evaluation drives vendor accountability and improvement.
    Poor performance evaluation results in:
    - Uninformed contract decisions
    - Poor performers retained
    - Top performers not recognized
    - No basis for performance discussions
    - Missed improvement opportunities
    - Inconsistent vendor treatment
    - Weak negotiating position
    - Value leakage from vendor relationships
    Effective evaluation enables performance-based management.

  when_to_run:
    - "Annual vendor evaluation cycles"
    - "Before contract renewals"
    - "During vendor consolidation"
    - "When implementing evaluation programs"
    - "After significant performance issues"

signals:
  critical:
    - id: "VPE-CRIT-001"
      signal: "No formal vendor performance evaluation"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Vendors not evaluated"
        - "No evaluation framework exists"
        - "Performance not measured"
      explanation: |
        Without evaluation, vendor performance cannot be managed
        and accountability does not exist.
      remediation: "Implement formal vendor performance evaluation program"

    - id: "VPE-CRIT-002"
      signal: "Evaluation criteria not defined"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "No documented criteria"
        - "Subjective evaluation only"
        - "Inconsistent measures used"
      explanation: |
        Clear criteria ensure fair, consistent, and defensible
        evaluations that drive improvement.
      remediation: "Define and document evaluation criteria"

    - id: "VPE-CRIT-003"
      signal: "Evaluation results not used"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Results filed and forgotten"
        - "No action on poor performance"
        - "Results not shared with vendors"
      explanation: |
        Evaluations without follow-up provide no value and
        undermine the evaluation program.
      remediation: "Use evaluation results to drive vendor actions"

  high:
    - id: "VPE-HIGH-001"
      signal: "Stakeholder input not gathered"
      explanation: "Stakeholders provide critical performance perspective"
      remediation: "Include stakeholder input in evaluations"

    - id: "VPE-HIGH-002"
      signal: "Evaluation frequency inadequate"
