  what: |
    Evaluates vendor onboarding processes including:
    - Due diligence requirements
    - Risk assessment procedures
    - Security questionnaires
    - Financial stability verification
    - Reference checks
    - Contract execution
    - System access provisioning
    - Integration procedures
    - Training and orientation
    - Documentation requirements
    - Compliance verification

  why_it_matters: |
    Effective onboarding establishes vendor relationships properly.
    Poor onboarding processes result in:
    - Unvetted vendors accessing systems and data
    - Security risks from inadequate due diligence
    - Contract gaps discovered after engagement
    - Integration failures and delays
    - Compliance violations from missing documentation
    - Relationship issues from unclear expectations
    - Financial exposure from unstable vendors
    Robust onboarding protects the organization from vendor risks.
