  what: |
    Evaluates cascading risk assessment including:
    - Supply chain failure propagation
    - Cascading impact analysis
    - Critical path vulnerabilities
    - Interdependency risk modeling
    - Failure scenario planning
    - Upstream risk transmission
    - Downstream impact assessment
    - Cross-vendor dependencies
    - Systemic risk identification
    - Mitigation strategy effectiveness

  why_it_matters: |
    Cascading risks amplify through supply chains exponentially.
    Poor cascading risk management results in:
    - Underestimated impact of vendor failures
    - Surprise cascading outages
    - Ineffective business continuity plans
    - Unidentified critical vulnerabilities
    - Systemic risk exposure
    - Inadequate risk reserves
    - Delayed incident response
    - Cascading compliance failures
    Understanding cascading risk enables proportionate controls.

  when_to_run:
    - "Annual risk assessments"
    - "After supply chain incidents"
    - "During business continuity planning"
    - "Before major vendor changes"
    - "When supply chain complexity increases"

        - "Risk assessments isolated to single vendors"
        - "No cascade impact analysis"
        - "Supply chain interdependencies not considered"
      explanation: |
        Isolated risk assessments miss cascading impacts that
        can multiply risk exponentially.
      remediation: "Implement cascading risk assessment methodology"

    - id: "CRA-CRIT-002"

        - "Known cascade potential without mitigation"
        - "Single points of failure in critical paths"
        - "No controls for cascade prevention"
      explanation: |
        Known cascading vulnerabilities without mitigation
        accept unacceptable levels of systemic risk.
      remediation: "Implement cascade mitigation controls"

    - id: "CRA-CRIT-003"

        - "BC plans assume isolated failures"
        - "No cascade scenarios tested"
        - "Recovery times assume no cascade"
      explanation: |
        BC plans that ignore cascading failures will be
        inadequate when cascading events occur.
