  what: |
    This audit examines the codebase for cryptographic agility - the ability
    to replace cryptographic algorithms without interrupting system operations.
    It identifies hard-coded algorithms, deprecated cryptographic functions,
    and assesses readiness for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) migration
    as recommended by NIST.
  why_it_matters: |
    Cryptographic algorithms have limited lifespans due to advancing attacks
    and computing power. The advent of quantum computing threatens current
    public-key cryptography (RSA, ECC, DH). NIST mandates PQC adoption by
    2035, with high-risk systems secure by 2030. Without crypto agility,
    algorithm migration requires extensive code changes, creating security
    gaps during transition. The "harvest now, decrypt later" threat means
    adversaries may already be collecting encrypted data for future decryption.
  when_to_run:
  - Initial security architecture review
  - When planning cryptographic infrastructure upgrades
  - During post-quantum readiness assessment
  - When deprecated algorithms are identified in use
  - Annual cryptographic inventory review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: AGILITY-CRIT-001
    signal: MD5 used for security-sensitive operations
    cwe: CWE-328
    evidence_pattern: (MD5|md5).*(password|auth|sign|hash|digest)
    explanation: |
      MD5 is cryptographically broken with practical collision attacks.
      It must not be used for passwords, digital signatures, or any
      security-sensitive operation. Collisions can be generated in
      seconds on commodity hardware.
    remediation: |
      Replace MD5 with SHA-256 or SHA-3 for general hashing.
      For passwords, use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.
      Plan for algorithm configurability to ease future transitions.
  - id: AGILITY-CRIT-002
    signal: SHA-1 used for digital signatures or certificates
    cwe: CWE-328
    evidence_pattern: (SHA1|sha1|SHA-1).*(sign|cert|signature)
    explanation: |
      SHA-1 has practical collision attacks (SHAttered). All major
      browsers and certificate authorities have deprecated SHA-1.
      Using SHA-1 for signatures enables forgery attacks.
    remediation: |
      Replace SHA-1 with SHA-256 or SHA-3 for signatures.
      Update all certificates to use SHA-256.
      Ensure CA chains do not include SHA-1 intermediates.
  - id: AGILITY-CRIT-003
    signal: DES or 3DES encryption in use
    cwe: CWE-327
    evidence_pattern: (DES|3DES|TripleDES|DESede)(?!cribe)
    explanation: |
      DES has a 56-bit key that can be brute-forced in hours.
      3DES is deprecated by NIST as of 2023 due to block size
      limitations (Sweet32 attack). Both are prohibited for new
      applications.
    remediation: |
      Replace with AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.
      Ensure new algorithm is configurable for future migration.
  - id: AGILITY-CRIT-004
    signal: RSA with key size less than 2048 bits
    cwe: CWE-326
    evidence_pattern: RSA.*(1024|512)|keysize.*(1024|512).*RSA|(1024|512).*bit.*RSA
    explanation: |
      RSA keys smaller than 2048 bits can be factored with sufficient
      resources. NIST requires minimum 2048-bit RSA, with 3072-bit
      recommended for protection beyond 2030.
    remediation: |
      Migrate to minimum 2048-bit RSA, preferably 3072-bit or 4096-bit.
      Consider migrating to ECC (Curve25519) for better performance.
      Plan for post-quantum algorithm migration.
  high:
  - id: AGILITY-HIGH-001
    signal: No cryptographic abstraction layer
    cwe: CWE-327
    evidence_indicators:
    - Direct crypto library calls scattered throughout codebase
    - Algorithm names hard-coded in multiple locations
    - No central crypto configuration
    explanation: |
      Without a cryptographic abstraction layer, algorithm changes
      require modifications throughout the codebase. This makes
      security updates slow and error-prone, extending vulnerability
      windows during algorithm deprecation.
    remediation: |
      Create a centralized cryptographic service/module.
      Abstract algorithm selection behind configuration.
      Use provider/factory patterns for algorithm instantiation.
      Maintain a cryptographic bill of materials (CBOM).
  - id: AGILITY-HIGH-002
    signal: CBC mode without authentication
    cwe: CWE-329
    evidence_pattern: CBC(?!.*MAC|.*HMAC|.*GCM|.*authenticated)
    explanation: |
      CBC mode without authentication is vulnerable to padding oracle
      attacks (e.g., POODLE, Lucky13). Attackers can decrypt data
      without knowing the key. OWASP recommends deprecating CBC.
    remediation: |
      Replace CBC with authenticated encryption (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305).
      If CBC must be used, always include HMAC authentication (Encrypt-then-MAC).
  - id: AGILITY-HIGH-003
    signal: Quantum-vulnerable cryptography for long-term secrets
    cwe: CWE-327
    evidence_pattern: (RSA|ECDSA|ECDH|DSA).*(master|root|long.?term|archive)
    explanation: |
      RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, and DSA will be broken by quantum computers.
      Data encrypted today with these algorithms may be harvested
      now and decrypted later when quantum computers are available.
      NIST requires PQC migration by 2035.
    remediation: |
      Inventory all quantum-vulnerable cryptography.
      Prioritize long-term secrets for PQC migration.
      Begin hybrid classical/PQC deployments (e.g., X25519 + ML-KEM).
      Follow NIST SP 1800-38 migration guidance.
  - id: AGILITY-HIGH-004
    signal: Hard-coded cipher suites in TLS configuration
    evidence_pattern: ssl_ciphers|cipherSuites.*["'].*:.*["']
    explanation: |
      Hard-coded cipher suites cannot be easily updated when
      vulnerabilities are discovered. This delays security updates
      and may require application redeployment.
    remediation: |
      Externalize cipher suite configuration.
      Use modern cipher suite ordering (TLS 1.3 preferred).
      Implement cipher suite monitoring and alerting.
  medium:
  - id: AGILITY-MED-001
    signal: No cryptographic inventory or CBOM
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documentation of algorithms in use
    - No cyclonedx CBOM generated
    - Cannot answer 'what algorithms do we use?'
    explanation: |
      Without a cryptographic inventory, organizations cannot assess
      their exposure to algorithm deprecation or plan migrations.
      CBOM (Cryptographic Bill of Materials) is emerging as a standard.
    remediation: |
      Create a cryptographic inventory documenting all algorithms,
      their locations, and purposes. Consider generating CBOM
      using tools like CycloneDX.
  - id: AGILITY-MED-002
    signal: RC4 or Blowfish in use
    cwe: CWE-327
    evidence_pattern: RC4|Blowfish
    explanation: |
      RC4 has known biases that leak plaintext. Blowfish has a
      64-bit block size vulnerable to birthday attacks. Both are
      deprecated for new applications.
    remediation: |
      Replace with AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.
  - id: AGILITY-MED-003
    signal: No post-quantum migration plan
    evidence_indicators:
    - No PQC roadmap documentation
    - No hybrid cryptography testing
    - No quantum risk assessment
    explanation: |
      NIST mandates PQC adoption by 2035 with high-risk systems
      secure by 2030. Without a migration plan, organizations risk
      missing deadlines and exposing data to harvest-now-decrypt-later
      attacks.
    remediation: |
      Assess quantum risk for all cryptographic assets.
      Create PQC migration roadmap following NIST SP 1800-38.
      Begin testing ML-KEM and ML-DSA in hybrid deployments.
  low:
  - id: AGILITY-LOW-001
    signal: SHA-1 used for non-security purposes
    evidence_pattern: sha1.*(checksum|etag|cache|version)
    explanation: |
      SHA-1 for checksums or cache keys is less critical but
      should still be migrated for consistency and to avoid
      accidental misuse in security contexts.
    remediation: |
      Consider migrating to SHA-256 for consistency.
      Clearly document non-security usage if SHA-1 is retained.
  positive:
  - id: AGILITY-POS-001
    signal: Cryptographic abstraction layer implemented
    evidence_pattern: (CryptoProvider|CryptoService|CryptoFactory|crypto_config)
    explanation: |
      A centralized cryptographic abstraction enables algorithm
      changes through configuration rather than code changes.
  - id: AGILITY-POS-002
    signal: Post-quantum algorithms in use or testing
    evidence_pattern: (ML-KEM|ML-DSA|Kyber|Dilithium|SPHINCS|post.?quantum|pqc)
    explanation: |
      Early adoption of post-quantum cryptography demonstrates
      forward-thinking security architecture and PQC readiness.
  - id: AGILITY-POS-003
    signal: Hybrid classical/PQC deployment
    evidence_pattern: (hybrid|X25519.*ML-KEM|classical.*quantum)
    explanation: |
      Hybrid deployments provide defense-in-depth during the
      PQC transition period, maintaining security even if one
      algorithm is later found vulnerable.
  - id: AGILITY-POS-004
    signal: Algorithm configuration externalized
    evidence_pattern: (algorithm|cipher).*(env|config|setting|yml|yaml|json)
    explanation: |
      Externalized algorithm configuration enables rapid updates
      without code deployment.
