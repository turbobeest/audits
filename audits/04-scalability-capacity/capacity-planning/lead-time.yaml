description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the lead times required to provision additional capacity
    across all resource types. Analyzes procurement timelines, deployment
    automation readiness, approval processes, and dependencies that
    affect how quickly capacity can be added when needed.
  why_it_matters: |
    Lead time determines how far in advance capacity must be planned.
    Long lead times require more headroom and earlier planning. Understanding
    lead times prevents capacity emergencies and enables appropriate
    planning horizons. Reducing lead times improves agility.
  when_to_run:
  - During capacity planning cycle setup
  - When experiencing capacity constraints
  - After infrastructure changes affecting provisioning
  - When evaluating cloud vs. on-premise decisions

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SCALE-LT-CRIT-001
    signal: Lead time exceeds capacity runway
    evidence_indicators:
    - Time to provision > time to exhaust headroom
    - No emergency provisioning procedure
    explanation: |
      If lead time to provision new capacity exceeds the time until
      current capacity is exhausted, the organization cannot respond
      to demand in time. This creates inevitable capacity failures.
    remediation: Reduce lead time or increase headroom buffer
  high:
  - id: SCALE-LT-HIGH-001
    signal: Manual provisioning with long lead times
    explanation: No infrastructure automation; weeks-long provisioning
    remediation: Implement infrastructure as code; automate provisioning
  - id: SCALE-LT-HIGH-002
    signal: Unknown provisioning lead times
    explanation: Organization cannot estimate capacity addition timeline
    remediation: Measure and document lead times for all resource types
  medium:
  - id: SCALE-LT-MED-001
    signal: Lead times not factored into capacity planning
    remediation: Incorporate lead times into planning horizon
  - id: SCALE-LT-MED-002
    signal: Inconsistent lead times due to approval bottlenecks
    remediation: Streamline approval processes; implement pre-approvals
  low:
  - id: SCALE-LT-LOW-001
    signal: Lead times not regularly measured
  positive:
  - id: SCALE-LT-POS-001
    signal: Fully automated provisioning with minutes-level lead time
  - id: SCALE-LT-POS-002
    signal: Lead times well-documented and factored into planning
