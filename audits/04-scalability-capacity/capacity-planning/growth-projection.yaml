description:
  what: |
    Analyzes growth projections used for capacity planning, evaluating
    their methodology, accuracy, and alignment with business forecasts.
    Reviews historical growth trends, projected growth rates, and the
    translation of business metrics to infrastructure requirements.
  why_it_matters: |
    Accurate growth projections enable appropriate capacity investment.
    Under-projection leads to capacity crises; over-projection wastes
    resources. Growth projections inform infrastructure budgets, hiring
    plans, and architectural decisions with long-term implications.
  when_to_run:
  - During annual planning cycles
  - When business growth assumptions change
  - After significant market changes
  - When launching new products or markets

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SCALE-GP-CRIT-001
    signal: No growth projections exist
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented growth forecasts
    - Capacity decisions made without projections
    explanation: |
      Without growth projections, capacity planning is purely reactive.
      This leads to last-minute scrambles for resources, budget overruns,
      and potential service degradation during growth periods.
    remediation: Develop growth projections aligned with business forecasts
  high:
  - id: SCALE-GP-HIGH-001
    signal: Growth projections not aligned with business forecasts
    explanation: Infrastructure plans assume different growth than business expects
    remediation: Align infrastructure growth projections with business forecasts
  - id: SCALE-GP-HIGH-002
    signal: Historical growth significantly exceeded projections
    explanation: Past under-projection indicates systematic forecasting issues
    remediation: Recalibrate projection methodology; add safety margins
  medium:
  - id: SCALE-GP-MED-001
    signal: Single growth scenario without contingencies
    remediation: Develop multiple scenarios (optimistic, baseline, pessimistic)
  - id: SCALE-GP-MED-002
    signal: Growth projections not regularly updated
    remediation: Implement quarterly projection updates
  low:
  - id: SCALE-GP-LOW-001
    signal: Projection methodology not documented
  positive:
  - id: SCALE-GP-POS-001
    signal: Accurate historical projections with documented methodology
  - id: SCALE-GP-POS-002
    signal: Multiple growth scenarios with contingency plans
