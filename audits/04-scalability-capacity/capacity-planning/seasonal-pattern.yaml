description:
  what: |
    Analyzes recurring seasonal patterns in traffic and resource usage
    across multiple time scales (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
    Identifies predictable variations that should inform capacity planning,
    auto-scaling configurations, and resource scheduling.
  why_it_matters: |
    Understanding seasonal patterns enables efficient resource utilization
    by scaling capacity to match predictable demand. Without seasonal
    analysis, organizations either over-provision (wasting money) or
    under-provision during predictable high-demand periods (causing
    performance issues).
  when_to_run:
  - During annual capacity planning
  - When implementing auto-scaling
  - Before seasonal high-demand periods
  - When optimizing infrastructure costs

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SCALE-SP-CRIT-001
    signal: Capacity insufficient for predictable seasonal peak
    evidence_indicators:
    - Historical seasonal peaks exceeded capacity
    - No capacity increase planned for approaching season
    explanation: |
      Failure to prepare for predictable seasonal peaks is an avoidable
      capacity planning failure. Historical data clearly shows the need,
      making under-provisioning inexcusable.
    remediation: Immediately plan capacity for upcoming seasonal peak
  high:
  - id: SCALE-SP-HIGH-001
    signal: Seasonal patterns not analyzed
    explanation: No seasonal decomposition performed on traffic data
    remediation: Conduct seasonal pattern analysis
  - id: SCALE-SP-HIGH-002
    signal: Auto-scaling not aligned with seasonal patterns
    explanation: Scaling parameters don't account for predictable variations
    remediation: Configure time-based scaling rules for known patterns
  medium:
  - id: SCALE-SP-MED-001
    signal: Daily patterns not optimized
    remediation: Implement time-of-day scaling adjustments
  - id: SCALE-SP-MED-002
    signal: Weekly patterns not utilized for maintenance windows
    remediation: Schedule maintenance during predictable low-traffic periods
  low:
  - id: SCALE-SP-LOW-001
