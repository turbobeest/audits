  what: |
    This audit examines the database sharding strategy including shard key
    selection, data distribution algorithms, shard placement, rebalancing
    mechanisms, and cross-shard coordination. It evaluates whether the
    sharding approach supports current and projected data volumes while
    maintaining acceptable query performance and operational complexity.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor sharding strategy leads to hot spots, uneven data distribution,
    expensive cross-shard queries, and operational nightmares during
    rebalancing. A single-shard bottleneck can bring down the entire
    application despite horizontal architecture. Changing shard keys
    after production deployment is extremely costly and risky.
  when_to_run:
  - Before implementing horizontal database scaling
  - When experiencing uneven load distribution across shards
  - Before major data model changes
  - When planning capacity for 10x growth
  - After observing hot shard patterns

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SHARD-CRIT-001
    signal: Single shard contains >50% of total data
    evidence_threshold: max(shard_size) / sum(shard_size) > 0.5
    explanation: |
      Extreme data skew defeats the purpose of sharding. One shard becomes
      the bottleneck, negating horizontal scaling benefits. This typically
      indicates a poor shard key choice that correlates with data hotspots.
    remediation: Re-evaluate shard key selection; consider composite keys or resharding
  - id: SHARD-CRIT-002
    signal: Shard key allows unbounded growth within single shard
    evidence_indicators:
    - Shard key based on customer_id with large enterprise customers
    - Sequential IDs as shard keys
    - No compound key for time-series data
    explanation: |
      Some entities grow without bound (enterprise customers, popular content).
      Using such entities as sole shard key creates inevitable hot shards.
    remediation: Use compound shard keys combining entity ID with time or hash component
  high:
  - id: SHARD-HIGH-001
    signal: No automated rebalancing mechanism
    explanation: Manual rebalancing is error-prone and creates operational burden
    remediation: Implement automated shard rebalancing with consistent hashing
  - id: SHARD-HIGH-002
    signal: Cross-shard transactions without proper coordination
    explanation: Distributed transactions without 2PC or saga patterns cause inconsistency
    remediation: Implement saga pattern or design to avoid cross-shard transactions
  medium:
  - id: SHARD-MED-001
    signal: Shard key not included in majority of queries
    remediation: Redesign queries to include shard key or reconsider sharding approach
  - id: SHARD-MED-002
    signal: No shard pruning in query execution
    remediation: Implement query analyzer that routes to specific shards when possible
  low:
  - id: SHARD-LOW-001
    signal: Shard naming convention inconsistent
  positive:
  - id: SHARD-POS-001
    signal: Consistent hash ring with virtual nodes implemented
  - id: SHARD-POS-002
    signal: Shard key analysis shows even distribution over 12+ months
