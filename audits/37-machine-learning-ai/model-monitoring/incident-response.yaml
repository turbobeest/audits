description:
  what: |
    Evaluates incident response procedures for ML systems including detection,
    triage, mitigation, communication, and post-incident review. Examines whether
    teams can effectively respond to model failures, degradation, and emergencies.
  why_it_matters: |
    ML systems can fail in unique ways that require specialized response procedures.
    Poor incident response extends the duration and impact of issues. Well-prepared
    teams with clear procedures minimize harm and restore service quickly.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing MLOps practices
  - After incident handling failures
  - During disaster recovery planning
  - Periodically for preparedness review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: IR-CRIT-001
    signal: No incident response procedures for ML
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented procedures
    - Ad hoc response to incidents
    - Unclear ownership and responsibilities
    explanation: |
      Without clear procedures, incident response is chaotic, slow, and error-prone,
      extending the duration and impact of ML failures.
    remediation: Develop and document ML incident response procedures
  - id: IR-CRIT-002
    signal: Unable to rollback problematic models
    evidence_indicators:
    - No rollback capability
    - Rollback procedures untested
    - Long time to rollback
    explanation: |
      Inability to rollback means problematic models continue serving until fixes
      are deployed, potentially causing extended harm.
    remediation: Implement and test rapid rollback procedures
  high:
  - id: IR-HIGH-001
    signal: No ML-specific runbooks
    remediation: Create runbooks for common ML failure scenarios
  - id: IR-HIGH-002
    signal: Unclear escalation paths
    remediation: Define clear escalation procedures
  - id: IR-HIGH-003
    signal: No post-incident reviews
    remediation: Conduct blameless post-mortems for incidents
  medium:
  - id: IR-MED-001
    signal: Communication procedures unclear
    remediation: Define stakeholder communication procedures
  - id: IR-MED-002

  - id: IR-MED-003
    signal: On-call rotation unclear
    remediation: Establish clear on-call schedules and responsibilities
  low:

    signal: Incident templates not defined
    remediation: Create incident documentation templates
