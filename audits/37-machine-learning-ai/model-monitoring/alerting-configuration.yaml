description:
  what: |
    Evaluates alerting configuration for ML systems including alert definitions,
    thresholds, notification routing, escalation procedures, and alert fatigue
    management. Examines whether alerts enable timely and appropriate response
    to model issues.
  why_it_matters: |
    Alerts are the critical bridge between monitoring and action. Poor alerting leads
    to missed issues (false negatives) or alert fatigue (false positives). Well-configured
    alerts ensure the right people are notified at the right time to address model
    problems quickly.
  when_to_run:
  - When setting up alerting systems
  - After alert fatigue complaints
  - When alerts miss critical issues
  - During incident post-mortems

signals:
  critical:
  - id: AC-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical issues not generating alerts
    evidence_indicators:
    - Model outages without alerts
    - Performance degradation missed
    - Thresholds set too high
    explanation: |
      Missing alerts on critical issues delays response and extends the duration
      of user impact and business harm.
    remediation: Review and lower thresholds for critical conditions
  - id: AC-CRIT-002
    signal: Alerts not reaching appropriate responders
    evidence_indicators:
    - No one on-call for alerts
    - Notification channels broken
    - Escalation not working
    explanation: |
      Alerts that don't reach responders are useless, allowing issues to continue
      affecting users without response.
    remediation: Verify notification routing and escalation procedures
  high:
  - id: AC-HIGH-001
    signal: Severe alert fatigue
    remediation: Reduce noise by tuning thresholds and consolidating alerts
  - id: AC-HIGH-002
    signal: No ML-specific alerts
    remediation: Add alerts for model performance, drift, and prediction issues
  - id: AC-HIGH-003
    signal: No alert documentation
    remediation: Document alert meanings and response procedures
  medium:
  - id: AC-MED-001
    signal: Alert thresholds static
    remediation: Implement dynamic thresholds based on baselines
  - id: AC-MED-002
    signal: No alert severity levels
    remediation: Define severity levels with appropriate routing
  - id: AC-MED-003
    signal: Escalation delays too long
    remediation: Reduce escalation timeouts for critical alerts
  low:
  - id: AC-LOW-001
    signal: Alert naming inconsistent
    remediation: Standardize alert naming conventions
  - id: AC-LOW-002
    signal: Alert history not analyzed
    remediation: Regularly review alert patterns
  positive:
  - id: AC-POS-001
    signal: Well-tuned alerts with minimal fatigue
  - id: AC-POS-002
    signal: Clear escalation with documented procedures
  - id: AC-POS-003
