description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the implementation and effectiveness of transfer learning approaches
    including pre-trained model selection, fine-tuning strategies, domain adaptation,
    and knowledge transfer validation. Examines whether transfer learning is applied
    appropriately and delivers expected benefits.
  why_it_matters: |
    Transfer learning can dramatically reduce training time and data requirements while
    improving performance. However, inappropriate pre-trained models or poor fine-tuning
    strategies can lead to negative transfer, where performance is worse than training
    from scratch. Proper implementation ensures benefits are realized.
  when_to_run:
  - When implementing transfer learning approaches
  - Before deploying fine-tuned models
  - When transfer learning performance is disappointing
  - During model efficiency optimization

  critical:
  - id: TL-CRIT-001
    signal: Negative transfer degrading performance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Fine-tuned model worse than from-scratch baseline
    - Pre-trained model domain incompatible with target
    - Catastrophic forgetting of useful knowledge
    explanation: |
      Negative transfer occurs when knowledge from the source domain hurts performance
      on the target domain, wasting resources and producing inferior models.
    remediation: Validate pre-trained model relevance and implement domain adaptation
  - id: TL-CRIT-002
    signal: Using pre-trained models with license violations
    evidence_indicators:
    - Commercial use of non-commercial licensed models
    - No attribution for required licenses
    - Derivative work restrictions violated
    explanation: |
      Many pre-trained models have restrictive licenses. Using them inappropriately
      creates legal liability and potential forced model replacement.
    remediation: Audit pre-trained model licenses and ensure compliance
