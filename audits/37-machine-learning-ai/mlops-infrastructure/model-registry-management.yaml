description:
  what: |
    Evaluates model registry infrastructure including model storage, versioning,
    staging workflows, metadata management, and access controls. Examines whether
    the registry enables reliable model lifecycle management.
  why_it_matters: |
    The model registry is the central system of record for ML models. A well-managed
    registry enables traceability, governance, and reliable deployments. Poor registry
    management leads to deployment confusion, compliance failures, and operational risk.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing MLOps practices
  - After registry issues
  - During ML governance reviews
  - When scaling model deployments

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MRM-CRIT-001
    signal: No model registry implemented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Models stored ad hoc
    - No version tracking
    - Cannot find model artifacts
    explanation: |
      Without a registry, model management is chaotic, leading to deployment
      confusion and compliance failures.
    remediation: Implement model registry
  - id: MRM-CRIT-002
    signal: Production models not in registry
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deployed models not registered
    - Cannot trace deployment to registry
    - Production model unknown
    explanation: |
      Unregistered production models cannot be tracked, audited, or safely
      managed, creating significant risk.
    remediation: Register all production models
  high:
  - id: MRM-HIGH-001
    signal: No staging workflow
    remediation: Implement staging stages for model promotion
  - id: MRM-HIGH-002
    signal: Model metadata incomplete
    remediation: Capture comprehensive model metadata
  - id: MRM-HIGH-003
    signal: Access controls missing
    remediation: Implement role-based access control
  medium:
  - id: MRM-MED-001
    signal: Model lineage not tracked
    remediation: Implement model lineage tracking
  - id: MRM-MED-002
    signal: No model approval workflow
    remediation: Add model approval gates
  - id: MRM-MED-003
    signal: Registry search difficult
    remediation: Improve model discovery
  low:
  - id: MRM-LOW-001
    signal: Registry documentation incomplete
    remediation: Document registry usage
  - id: MRM-LOW-002
    signal: Model naming inconsistent
    remediation: Establish naming conventions
  positive:
  - id: MRM-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive registry with all models tracked
  - id: MRM-POS-002
    signal: Clear staging workflow with approvals
  - id: MRM-POS-003
    signal: Full model lineage and metadata
