description:
  what: |
    Evaluates ML-specific CI/CD practices including automated testing, model validation,
    deployment pipelines, and continuous training. Examines whether ML changes can be
    reliably and safely deployed to production.
  why_it_matters: |
    ML CI/CD enables rapid, reliable iteration on ML systems. Without proper CI/CD,
    deployments are risky, slow, and error-prone. Good ML CI/CD automates testing,
    validation, and deployment while maintaining safety and quality.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing MLOps practices
  - After deployment failures
  - During DevOps maturity assessments
  - When accelerating ML delivery

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MLCICD-CRIT-001
    signal: No automated deployment pipeline
    evidence_indicators:
    - Manual model deployments
    - No deployment automation
    - Ad hoc production updates
    explanation: |
      Manual deployments are slow, error-prone, and risky, preventing rapid
      iteration and increasing deployment failures.
    remediation: Implement automated deployment pipelines
  - id: MLCICD-CRIT-002
    signal: No testing in CI/CD
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deployments without tests
    - No model validation
    - Untested code reaching production
    explanation: |
      Deploying without testing allows broken models and code to reach production,
      causing user impact and business harm.
    remediation: Add comprehensive testing to CI/CD
  high:
  - id: MLCICD-HIGH-001
    signal: No model validation in pipeline
