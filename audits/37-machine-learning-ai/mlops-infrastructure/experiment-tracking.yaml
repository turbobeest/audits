description:
  what: |
    Evaluates experiment tracking infrastructure including parameter logging, metric
    tracking, artifact storage, experiment comparison, and reproducibility support.
    Examines whether experiments are properly tracked for collaboration and reproducibility.
  why_it_matters: |
    Experiment tracking is foundational to effective ML development. Without proper
    tracking, teams waste effort repeating experiments, cannot reproduce results, and
    lose valuable learning. Good tracking accelerates ML development and enables
    data-driven model decisions.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing MLOps practices
  - After tracking gaps discovered
  - During ML platform reviews
  - When onboarding new teams

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ET-CRIT-001
    signal: No experiment tracking implemented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Experiments not logged
    - Cannot find past experiment results
    - Unable to reproduce experiments
    explanation: |
      Without experiment tracking, ML development is inefficient and unreliable,
      leading to repeated work and non-reproducible results.
    remediation: Implement experiment tracking with MLflow or similar
  - id: ET-CRIT-002
    signal: Tracking data lost or corrupted
    evidence_indicators:
    - Historical experiments missing
    - Artifact storage failures
    - Metrics data corrupted
    explanation: |
      Lost tracking data destroys valuable institutional knowledge and makes
      historical comparisons impossible.
    remediation: Implement proper backup and data integrity checks
  high:
  - id: ET-HIGH-001
    signal: Inconsistent tracking across projects
    remediation: Standardize tracking practices organization-wide
  - id: ET-HIGH-002
    signal: Artifacts not versioned with experiments
    remediation: Link artifacts to experiment runs
  - id: ET-HIGH-003
    signal: No experiment comparison capability
    remediation: Enable experiment comparison and analysis
  medium:
  - id: ET-MED-001
    signal: Tracking coverage incomplete
    remediation: Track all relevant parameters, metrics, and artifacts
  - id: ET-MED-002
    signal: No tagging or organization system
    remediation: Implement experiment tagging and organization
  - id: ET-MED-003
    signal: Experiment search difficult
    remediation: Improve experiment search and filtering
  low:
  - id: ET-LOW-001
    signal: Tracking documentation incomplete
    remediation: Document tracking conventions
  - id: ET-LOW-002
    signal: Experiment naming inconsistent
    remediation: Establish naming conventions
  positive:
  - id: ET-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive tracking with all metadata
