  what: |
    This audit evaluates README file quality across repositories:
    - Existence and visibility
    - Project description and purpose
    - Getting started instructions
    - Usage examples
    - Configuration documentation
    - Contribution guidelines
    - Maintenance status indicators

    READMEs are the front door to projects and often the first
    documentation new users encounter.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor READMEs lead to:
    - Confusion about what a project does
    - Inability to get started quickly
    - Reduced adoption of internal libraries
    - Repeated questions to maintainers
    - Abandoned projects appearing maintained

    Good READMEs enable self-service understanding, reduce support
    burden, and improve project adoption.
  when_to_run:
  - Before open sourcing projects
  - As part of documentation review
  - When project visibility increases
  - Quarterly documentation hygiene
