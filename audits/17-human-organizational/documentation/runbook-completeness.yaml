  what: |
    This audit assesses operational runbook quality and coverage:
    - Incident response procedures for each service
    - Common troubleshooting guides
    - Operational procedures (deployment, rollback, scaling)
    - Escalation paths and decision trees
    - Recovery procedures for failure scenarios

    It evaluates whether on-call engineers can effectively respond
    to incidents using available documentation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Incomplete runbooks lead to:
    - Extended incident durations while engineers figure things out
    - Incorrect actions that worsen incidents
    - Knowledge loss when experienced engineers leave
    - Inconsistent incident handling quality
    - Increased stress and burnout for on-call engineers

    Complete runbooks enable faster incident resolution, reduce
    cognitive load on responders, and ensure consistent handling.
  when_to_run:
  - After major incidents reveal documentation gaps
  - Before new service launches
  - Quarterly operational readiness review
  - When on-call rotation changes

      grep -r "runbook_url" alerts/*.yaml || echo "No runbook links found"
signals:
  critical:
  - id: RUN-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical service has no runbooks
    evidence_indicators:
    - High-criticality service lacks any runbook
    - On-call cannot find guidance for service
    - Incidents require escalation for any issue
    explanation: |
      Critical services without runbooks mean every incident
      requires heroics from experienced engineers. This is
      unsustainable and leads to extended outages.
    remediation: Create minimum viable runbook for critical service immediately
  - id: RUN-CRIT-002
    signal: Runbooks contain dangerous incorrect information
    evidence_indicators:
    - Commands in runbook would cause damage
    - Procedures are for different environment
    - Steps are severely outdated
    explanation: |
      Incorrect runbooks can turn minor incidents into major
      outages when responders follow bad guidance.
    remediation: Immediately correct or remove dangerous runbooks
  high:
  - id: RUN-HIGH-001
    signal: Alerts have no linked runbooks
    evidence_indicators:
    - Alert fires with no runbook_url
    - On-call must search for relevant docs
    - Response time extended by doc hunting
    explanation: |
      When alerts don't link to runbooks, responders waste
      critical time finding relevant documentation.
    remediation: Link all alerts to relevant runbooks
  - id: RUN-HIGH-002
    signal: Common failure scenarios undocumented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Repeat incidents have no runbook
    - Postmortems recommend runbooks not created
    - Knowledge exists only in people's heads
    explanation: |
      Common failures that recur should have documented
      procedures to enable consistent, fast response.
    remediation: Create runbooks for frequent incident types
  medium:
  - id: RUN-MED-001
    signal: Runbooks lack sufficient detail
    evidence_indicators:
    - Steps too vague to follow
    - Missing commands or specific actions
    - Assumes too much knowledge
    remediation: Enhance runbooks with specific, actionable steps
  - id: RUN-MED-002
    signal: Runbooks not tested or validated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Procedures not validated in practice
    - Commands may not work as written
    - No review process for changes
    remediation: Implement runbook testing and review process
  low:
  - id: RUN-LOW-001
    signal: Runbook format inconsistent
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different formats across teams
    - Varying levels of detail
    - Hard to navigate structure
    remediation: Standardize runbook template and format
  positive:
  - id: RUN-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive runbook coverage
    evidence_indicators:
    - All critical services have runbooks
    - Alerts link to relevant runbooks
    - Runbooks are current and validated
    - On-call finds them useful
