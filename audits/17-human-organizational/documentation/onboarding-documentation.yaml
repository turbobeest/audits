  what: |
    This audit evaluates onboarding documentation quality:
    - Environment setup guides
    - Architecture and system overviews
    - Development workflow documentation
    - Access provisioning guides
    - First contribution guides
    - Team practices and conventions

    It assesses whether new engineers can become productive without
    excessive hand-holding from teammates.

  why_it_matters: |
    Poor onboarding documentation leads to:
    - Extended time to productivity for new hires
    - Excessive burden on existing team members
    - Frustration and poor early experience
    - Inconsistent knowledge transfer
    - Hidden assumptions that trip up newcomers

    Good onboarding documentation accelerates productivity, reduces
    burden on the team, and improves new hire experience.

    - "Before hiring rounds"
    - "When onboarding feedback indicates issues"

        - "New hires rely entirely on verbal guidance"
        - "Onboarding is ad-hoc and inconsistent"

        Without onboarding documentation, every new hire requires
        extensive hand-holding, and knowledge transfer is unreliable.
