  what: |
    This audit assesses architecture documentation quality across:
    - System context diagrams and boundaries
    - Component diagrams and interactions
    - Data flow documentation
    - Integration patterns and APIs
    - Decision records and rationale
    - Non-functional requirements and constraints

    It evaluates whether documentation enables understanding, evolution,
    and maintenance of the system architecture.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor architecture documentation leads to:
    - Wrong decisions from incomplete understanding
    - Duplicate systems built when existing ones unknown
    - Integration failures from misunderstood boundaries
    - Technical debt from lost architectural intent
    - Slow onboarding and knowledge transfer

    Good architecture documentation enables teams to understand systems,
    make informed decisions, and evolve architecture appropriately.
  when_to_run:
  - Before major architectural changes
  - During system audits and reviews
  - When onboarding new team members
  - Annually as part of documentation hygiene

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ARCH-CRIT-001
    signal: No architecture documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No architecture diagrams found
    - No system context documentation
    - Engineers cannot explain overall architecture
    explanation: |
      Systems without architecture documentation are impossible to
      understand holistically. This leads to poor decisions, integration
      failures, and inability to evolve the system safely.
    remediation: Create foundational architecture documentation (C4 Level 1-2)
  - id: ARCH-CRIT-002
    signal: Architecture documentation completely outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Diagrams show components that no longer exist
    - Major system changes not reflected
    - Documentation contradicts current implementation
    explanation: |
      Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation as it
      actively misleads readers and leads to incorrect decisions.
    remediation: Update documentation to reflect current state
  high:
  - id: ARCH-HIGH-001
    signal: Missing critical architecture views
    evidence_indicators:
    - No data flow documentation
    - Security boundaries not documented
    - Integration points not shown
    explanation: |
      Missing critical views leaves important aspects of the
      architecture undocumented and prone to misunderstanding.
    remediation: Add missing architecture views
  - id: ARCH-HIGH-002
    signal: No decision rationale documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No ADRs or equivalent
    - Architectural choices unexplained
    - Why questions unanswerable
    explanation: |
      Without decision rationale, teams repeat mistakes and
      cannot understand when conditions change that warrant revision.
    remediation: Implement ADR practice for significant decisions
  medium:
  - id: ARCH-MED-001
    signal: Inconsistent documentation coverage
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some systems well-documented, others not
    - Different formats and approaches
    - No documentation standards
    remediation: Establish documentation standards and fill gaps
  - id: ARCH-MED-002
    signal: Diagrams not maintainable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Binary diagram files without source
    - No diagram-as-code approach
    - Diagrams in inaccessible tools
    remediation: Adopt diagram-as-code for maintainability
  low:
  - id: ARCH-LOW-001
    signal: Documentation scattered across locations
    evidence_indicators:
    - Architecture docs in wiki, repo, and slides
    - No single source of truth
    remediation: Consolidate documentation with clear links
  positive:
  - id: ARCH-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive, current architecture documentation
    evidence_indicators:
    - C4 or equivalent diagrams at multiple levels
    - ADRs for significant decisions
    - Regular documentation updates
    - Engineers can navigate and understand
