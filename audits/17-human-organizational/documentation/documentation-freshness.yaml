  what: |
    This audit assesses documentation currency:
    - Last update dates vs system changes
    - Documentation review cadence
    - Stale document detection
    - Documentation maintenance process
    - Version alignment between docs and systems

    It identifies documentation that has drifted from reality
    and evaluates processes to keep docs current.
  why_it_matters: |
    Stale documentation causes:
    - Incorrect actions based on outdated information
    - Lost trust in documentation leading to avoidance
    - Wasted time discovering docs are wrong
    - Dangerous operational mistakes
    - Cumulative drift until docs become useless

    Fresh documentation maintains credibility and enables safe,
    efficient operations.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly documentation review
  - After major system changes
  - When documentation trust issues emerge
  - Annual documentation audit

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FRESH-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical documentation severely outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Runbooks reference removed systems
    - Architecture docs show deleted components
    - Procedures describe deprecated processes
    explanation: |
      Severely outdated critical documentation is dangerous.
      Users following incorrect procedures may cause incidents.
    remediation: Immediately update or remove dangerously stale docs
  high:
  - id: FRESH-HIGH-001
    signal: Documentation not updated after major changes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Major system change with no doc update
    - Docs still describe old architecture
    - Recent changes not reflected
    explanation: |
      Documentation that doesn't track major changes quickly
      becomes misleading and unreliable.
    remediation: Update docs to reflect recent changes
  - id: FRESH-HIGH-002
    signal: No documentation maintenance process
    evidence_indicators:
    - No review cadence
    - No ownership for doc updates
    - Docs drift until obviously wrong
    explanation: |
      Without maintenance process, documentation inevitably
      drifts from reality.
    remediation: Establish documentation review and maintenance process
  medium:
  - id: FRESH-MED-001
    signal: Large documentation backlog
    evidence_indicators:
    - Many docs flagged as needing review
    - Significant percentage over review threshold
    - Updates consistently delayed
    remediation: Prioritize and address documentation backlog
  - id: FRESH-MED-002
    signal: No freshness indicators in docs
    evidence_indicators:
    - No last-updated dates
    - No review dates
    - Users can't assess currency
    remediation: Add freshness metadata to documentation
  low:
  - id: FRESH-LOW-001
    signal: Review process not automated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Manual tracking of review dates
    - No reminders or alerts
    remediation: Automate documentation review reminders
  positive:
  - id: FRESH-POS-001
    signal: Documentation actively maintained
    evidence_indicators:
    - Regular review cadence
    - Docs updated with system changes
    - Freshness metadata visible
    - Users trust documentation currency
