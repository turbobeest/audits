  what: |
    This audit identifies knowledge that exists only as "tribal knowledge":
    - Undocumented system behaviors and workarounds
    - Historical context for decisions
    - Operational procedures held in heads
    - Institutional knowledge about why things are done
    - Relationships and informal processes

    It assesses the risk of losing this knowledge and prioritizes
    documentation or knowledge transfer efforts.
  why_it_matters: |
    Tribal knowledge creates severe organizational risk:
    - Knowledge lost when people leave
    - Inability to maintain systems when experts unavailable
    - New team members cannot become effective
    - Decisions made without critical context
    - Hidden single points of failure

    Capturing tribal knowledge builds organizational resilience
    and enables scale without dependency on specific individuals.
  when_to_run:
  - When key personnel announce departure
  - During succession planning
  - Annual knowledge risk assessment
  - Before major organizational changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TK-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical system knowledge held by one person
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single person understands critical system
    - No documentation exists
    - System essential for business operations
    explanation: |
      When critical system knowledge is held by one person with
      no documentation, the organization is one departure away
      from inability to maintain the system.
    remediation: Urgent knowledge extraction and documentation
  - id: TK-CRIT-002
    signal: Key knowledge holder departing with no transfer
    evidence_indicators:
    - Person leaving holds unique knowledge
    - No knowledge transfer scheduled
    - Documentation incomplete
    explanation: |
      Imminent departure of key knowledge holder without transfer
      will result in permanent knowledge loss.
    remediation: Immediate intensive knowledge transfer
  high:
  - id: TK-HIGH-001
    signal: High-tenure concentration without succession
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical knowledge held only by long-tenured staff
    - No cross-training or documentation efforts
    - Retirement or departure risk exists
    explanation: |
      Concentration of knowledge in long-tenured employees
      without succession planning creates time-bomb risk.
    remediation: Begin knowledge transfer and documentation program
  - id: TK-HIGH-002
    signal: Operational procedures exist only as tribal knowledge
    evidence_indicators:
    - Procedures not in runbooks
    - On-call relies on escalation to experts
    - Common tasks require asking specific people
    explanation: |
      Undocumented operational procedures make operations
      dependent on specific individuals' availability.
    remediation: Document operational procedures in runbooks
  medium:
  - id: TK-MED-001
    signal: Historical context not captured
    evidence_indicators:
    - Decisions made without understanding history

    remediation: Capture historical context in decision records
  - id: TK-MED-002
    signal: Workarounds and edge cases undocumented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Special cases handled by tribal knowledge
    - Workarounds known only to experienced staff
    remediation: Document workarounds and edge cases
  low:
  - id: TK-LOW-001
    signal: Informal relationships as knowledge
    evidence_indicators:
    - Who to call not documented
    - Relationships needed to get things done
    remediation: Document contacts and relationships
  positive:
  - id: TK-POS-001
    signal: Knowledge well-distributed and documented
    evidence_indicators:
