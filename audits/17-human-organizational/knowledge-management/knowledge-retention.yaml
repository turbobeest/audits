    This audit evaluates knowledge retention practices:
    - Offboarding knowledge transfer processes
    - Documentation handoff requirements
    - Succession planning practices
    - Knowledge continuity during transitions
    - Historical knowledge preservation

    It assesses whether the organization systematically retains
    knowledge when people change roles or leave.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor knowledge retention leads to:
    - Permanent knowledge loss when people leave
    - Repeated learning of solved problems
    - Orphaned systems no one understands
    - Inability to maintain or evolve past work
    - Organizational amnesia losing past lessons

    Effective retention preserves organizational learning and
    enables continuity despite personnel changes.
  when_to_run:
  - When significant turnover occurs
  - Before anticipated departures
  - Annual organizational health review
  - When orphaned systems identified

    questions:
    - How do you handle knowledge transfer when someone leaves?
    - Have you lost critical knowledge from departures?
    - What succession planning do you do?
    - How do you ensure continuity of knowledge?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RET-CRIT-001
    signal: No knowledge transfer during departures
    evidence_indicators:
    - Offboarding has no knowledge component
    - People leave without documenting
    - Significant knowledge lost to departures
    explanation: |
      When departures don't include knowledge transfer, every
      departure causes permanent knowledge loss.
    remediation: Add mandatory knowledge transfer to offboarding
  - id: RET-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical knowledge lost to recent departure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Systems now unmaintainable
    - No one knows how things work
    - Documentation incomplete or missing
    explanation: |
      Recent departure has already caused knowledge loss
      that cannot be fully recovered.
    remediation: Emergency recovery and prevent future loss
  high:
  - id: RET-HIGH-001
    signal: Knowledge transfer is optional or unenforced
    evidence_indicators:
    - Knowledge transfer depends on individual goodwill
    - Short notice departures skip transfer
    - No accountability for transfer quality
    explanation: |
      Optional transfer means knowledge will be lost
      whenever transfer is inconvenient.
    remediation: Make knowledge transfer mandatory and supported
  - id: RET-HIGH-002
    signal: No succession planning
    evidence_indicators:
    - Key roles have no identified successors
    - Knowledge concentrated without backup
    - Departures always surprise
    explanation: |
      Without succession planning, departures always
      trigger scrambles and knowledge gaps.
    remediation: Implement succession planning for key roles
  medium:
  - id: RET-MED-001
    signal: Knowledge transfer insufficient
    evidence_indicators:
    - Transfer happens but is superficial
    - Recipients report gaps
    - Time pressure shortens transfer
    remediation: Improve transfer process with more time and structure
  - id: RET-MED-002
    signal: Historical knowledge not preserved
    evidence_indicators:
    - No one knows why past decisions made
    - Context lost over multiple transitions
    - Historical lessons not captured
    remediation: Capture and preserve historical knowledge
  low:
  - id: RET-LOW-001
    signal: Knowledge transfer not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No record of what was transferred
    - Transfer quality not assessed
    remediation: Track and verify knowledge transfers
  positive:
  - id: RET-POS-001
    signal: Robust knowledge retention practices
    evidence_indicators:
    - Mandatory structured knowledge transfer
    - Succession planning in place
    - Historical knowledge preserved
    - Transitions go smoothly
