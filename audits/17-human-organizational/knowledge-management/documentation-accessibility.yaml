  what: |
    This audit assesses documentation accessibility:
    - Can people find documentation when needed?
    - Are access permissions appropriate?
    - Is documentation in consistent locations?
    - Are formats accessible and readable?
    - Does search work effectively?

    It evaluates whether documentation exists but is practically
    inaccessible due to discoverability or access issues.
  why_it_matters: |
    Inaccessible documentation is as bad as no documentation:
    - People waste time searching or recreating
    - Important information goes unused
    - Knowledge silos persist despite documentation
    - Frustration leads to documentation avoidance
    - Investment in documentation is wasted

    Accessible documentation enables self-service and reduces
    dependency on asking others.
  when_to_run:
  - As part of documentation audit
  - When discoverability complaints arise
  - After documentation platform changes
  - During onboarding process review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ACC-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical documentation not accessible to those who need it
    evidence_indicators:
    - Runbooks inaccessible to on-call engineers
    - API docs blocked by permissions
    - Essential docs behind paywall or locked
    explanation: |
      When critical documentation is inaccessible to people who
      need it, it might as well not exist. This creates emergency
      situations during incidents.
    remediation: Fix permissions immediately for critical docs
  high:
  - id: ACC-HIGH-001
    signal: Documentation scattered and unfindable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Docs in multiple locations with no index
    - Users cannot find documentation they know exists
    - No clear entry point for documentation
    explanation: |
      Scattered documentation forces users to search multiple
      places or give up and ask people instead.
    remediation: Consolidate documentation with clear navigation
  - id: ACC-HIGH-002
    signal: Search does not return relevant results
    evidence_indicators:
    - Searches return wrong or stale content
    - Search doesn't index all documentation
    - Users don't trust search
    explanation: |
      Ineffective search means even well-organized documentation
      cannot be discovered when needed.
    remediation: Improve search indexing and relevance
  medium:
  - id: ACC-MED-001
    signal: Inconsistent documentation locations
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some teams use wiki, others use repo
    - No standard for where docs live
    - Different platforms for similar content
    remediation: Standardize documentation locations
  - id: ACC-MED-002
    signal: Documentation format barriers
    evidence_indicators:
    - Docs in formats users can't open
    - Binary files without source
    - Platform-specific formats
    remediation: Use accessible, portable formats
  low:
  - id: ACC-LOW-001
    signal: Documentation lacks navigation aids
    evidence_indicators:
    - No table of contents
    - No cross-links between related docs
    - Poor categorization
    remediation: Add navigation and cross-referencing
  positive:
  - id: ACC-POS-001
    signal: Documentation easily accessible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear entry point and navigation
    - Effective search
    - Appropriate permissions
    - Users report easy findability
