  what: |
    This audit evaluates knowledge sharing practices including:
    - Formal knowledge sharing mechanisms (tech talks, brown bags)
    - Documentation practices and habits
    - Code review as knowledge transfer
    - Pairing and mentorship programs
    - Cross-team collaboration practices
    - Post-incident and retrospective learning

    It assesses whether the organization actively promotes knowledge
    flow or allows silos to form.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor knowledge sharing leads to:
    - Duplicated effort across teams
    - Repeated mistakes from unshared learnings
    - Slow onboarding and skill development
    - Fragile systems dependent on individual knowledge
    - Innovation stagnation from isolated teams

    Active knowledge sharing accelerates learning, reduces redundancy,
    and builds organizational resilience.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual organizational health assessment
  - When silos are identified as problems
  - During team growth periods
  - After organizational restructuring

signals:
  critical:
  - id: KS-CRIT-001
    signal: No knowledge sharing mechanisms exist
    evidence_indicators:
    - No tech talks or learning sessions
    - No documentation culture
    - Teams operate as isolated silos
    - Duplication of effort is common
    explanation: |
      Organizations without knowledge sharing mechanisms waste
      effort, repeat mistakes, and fail to leverage collective
      learning. This is unsustainable at scale.
    remediation: Establish basic knowledge sharing programs
  high:
  - id: KS-HIGH-001
    signal: Knowledge sharing is one-way only
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only senior engineers share knowledge
    - No mechanisms for junior engineers to contribute
    - Knowledge flows top-down only
    explanation: |
      One-way knowledge sharing misses valuable ground-level
      insights and doesn't build sharing habits organization-wide.
    remediation: Create inclusive knowledge sharing opportunities
  - id: KS-HIGH-002
    signal: Learnings from failures not shared
    evidence_indicators:
    - Incident postmortems not broadly shared
    - Teams repeat same mistakes
    - Blame culture inhibits sharing
    explanation: |
      Failure to share learnings from incidents and mistakes
      means the organization cannot learn from experience.
    remediation: Establish blameless postmortem sharing practice
  medium:
  - id: KS-MED-001
    signal: Knowledge sharing poorly attended
    evidence_indicators:
    - Low attendance at tech talks
    - Same few people always present
    - Sessions seen as optional overhead
    remediation: Make knowledge sharing more relevant and valued
  - id: KS-MED-002
    signal: Cross-team knowledge sharing lacking
    evidence_indicators:
    - Knowledge shared within teams only
    - Teams unaware of other teams' work
    - No cross-team learning forums
    remediation: Create cross-team knowledge sharing opportunities
  low:
  - id: KS-LOW-001
    signal: Knowledge sharing not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No metrics on knowledge sharing
    - Impact of sharing unknown
    remediation: Track knowledge sharing participation and impact
  positive:
  - id: KS-POS-001
    signal: Vibrant knowledge sharing culture
    evidence_indicators:
    - Regular tech talks with good attendance
    - Active documentation practice
    - Cross-team learning forums
    - Sharing seen as valuable
