  what: |
    This audit evaluates search and discovery capabilities:
    - Documentation search effectiveness
    - Code search capabilities
    - People/expertise search
    - Service/API discovery
    - Cross-platform search integration

    It assesses whether people can find what they need quickly
    when they don't know exactly where it is.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor search and discoverability:
    - Wastes time looking for existing resources
    - Leads to duplicate work when existing solutions unfound
    - Forces reliance on asking others
    - Makes documentation investment worthless
    - Slows onboarding and problem-solving

    Effective discovery enables self-service and scales knowledge
    access as organizations grow.
  when_to_run:
  - When search complaints increase
  - During platform evaluation
  - After significant content growth
  - As part of knowledge management audit
prerequisites:

    description: Search systems and tools
  access_requirements:
  - Access to search systems
  - Ability to test search queries
  - User feedback on search experience

  interviews:
  - role: Engineers
    questions:
    - How do you search for documentation?
    - How do you find code examples or similar implementations?
    - How do you discover what APIs or services exist?
    - How do you find who knows about something?
    - What frustrates you about finding information?
    purpose: Understand search experience

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DISC-CRIT-001
    signal: No search capability exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documentation search
    - No code search
    - Users must know exact locations
    explanation: |
      Without search, knowledge access doesn't scale.
      Finding information requires knowing where it is already.
    remediation: Implement basic search capabilities
  high:
  - id: DISC-HIGH-001
    signal: Search returns poor results
    evidence_indicators:
    - Relevant results buried or missing
    - Stale content ranked highly
    - Users don't trust search results
    explanation: |
      Search that returns poor results is often worse than no
      search, as users waste time reviewing irrelevant results.
    remediation: Tune search relevance and indexing
  - id: DISC-HIGH-002
    signal: Cannot discover existing services or APIs
    evidence_indicators:
    - No service catalog
    - Teams unaware of existing capabilities
    - Duplicate services built
    explanation: |
      Inability to discover existing services leads to
      duplication and fragmentation.
    remediation: Implement service catalog with search
  medium:
  - id: DISC-MED-001
    signal: Fragmented search across platforms
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different searches for different platforms
    - No unified search experience
    - Users must search multiple places
    remediation: Integrate search across platforms
  - id: DISC-MED-002
    signal: Cannot find people or expertise
    evidence_indicators:
    - No way to search for who knows what
    - Finding experts requires asking around
    - Skills not discoverable
    remediation: Implement expertise/people search
  low:
  - id: DISC-LOW-001
    signal: Search lacks filtering or facets
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot filter by type, date, or owner
    - Large result sets hard to navigate
    remediation: Add search filtering capabilities
  positive:
  - id: DISC-POS-001
    signal: Effective search and discovery
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users find what they need quickly
    - Search returns relevant results
    - Services and expertise discoverable
