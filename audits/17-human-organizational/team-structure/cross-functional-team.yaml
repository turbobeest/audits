  what: |
    This audit assesses whether stream-aligned teams have the cross-functional
    capabilities needed to deliver value end-to-end, including:
    - Frontend and backend development skills
    - DevOps and infrastructure capabilities
    - Quality assurance and testing expertise
    - Product and design involvement
    - Data and analytics skills where needed

    It identifies excessive dependencies on external teams that slow delivery.
  why_it_matters: |
    Teams that lack cross-functional capabilities face:
    - Handoff delays waiting for other teams
    - Coordination overhead reducing velocity
    - Fragmented ownership leading to quality gaps
    - Reduced autonomy limiting innovation

    Truly cross-functional teams can own features end-to-end, make decisions
    quickly, and deliver value to customers without extensive coordination.
  when_to_run:
  - During team formation or restructuring
  - When delivery velocity consistently lags
  - During organizational design reviews
  - After identifying coordination bottlenecks

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CFT-CRIT-001
    signal: Team cannot deliver any feature independently
    evidence_indicators:
    - Every feature requires multiple team handoffs
    - Team has only one type of skill (e.g., only backend)
    - Delivery velocity limited by external dependencies
    explanation: |
      A team that cannot independently deliver any feature is not
      truly a team - it's a component group that creates coordination
      overhead and delivery delays.
    remediation: Restructure team to include required capabilities or redefine scope
  high:
  - id: CFT-HIGH-001
    signal: Missing critical capability for core work
    evidence_indicators:
    - Team lacks infrastructure skills for owned services
    - No QA capability despite quality responsibilities
    - Frontend team with no design involvement
    explanation: |
      Missing capabilities for core team responsibilities creates
      constant external dependencies and fragmented ownership.
    remediation: Add missing capability through hiring, training, or embedded support
  - id: CFT-HIGH-002
    signal: Excessive dependency on enabling teams
    evidence_indicators:
    - '>50% of work requires platform team involvement'
    - Long wait times for infrastructure changes
    - Platform team bottlenecked by requests
    explanation: |
      Heavy reliance on enabling teams indicates either missing
      self-service capabilities or skill gaps in stream-aligned teams.
    remediation: Invest in self-service platforms and team enablement
  medium:
  - id: CFT-MED-001
    signal: Partial cross-functional gaps
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some work types require external help
    - Specific skills available but thin (single person)
    - Cross-functional work slows but doesn't stop
    remediation: Strengthen weak capability areas through training or hiring
  - id: CFT-MED-002
    signal: Unclear team boundaries
    evidence_indicators:
    - Disputes over ownership of work
    - Duplicate work across teams
    - Customers unsure which team to contact
    remediation: Clarify team scope and establish clear ownership
  low:
  - id: CFT-LOW-001
    signal: Informal cross-functional collaboration
    evidence_indicators:
    - Skills exist across teams but not within teams
    - People borrowed informally for projects
    remediation: Formalize cross-functional structure or embedding
  positive:
  - id: CFT-POS-001
    signal: Team delivers end-to-end independently
    evidence_indicators:
    - Most features delivered without handoffs
    - Team has all skills needed for core work
    - External dependencies are strategic, not routine
