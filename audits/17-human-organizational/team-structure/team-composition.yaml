  what: |
    This audit examines the composition of engineering teams to assess whether
    they have an appropriate balance of:
    - Technical skill levels (junior, mid, senior, staff)
    - Domain expertise coverage
    - Experience diversity (tenure, backgrounds)
    - Role distribution (engineers, tech leads, architects)

    The audit evaluates whether teams are structured to deliver both short-term
    velocity and long-term sustainability.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor team composition leads to:
    - Knowledge silos when expertise is concentrated in few individuals
    - Burnout when senior engineers carry disproportionate load
    - Slow onboarding when there's insufficient mentorship capacity
    - Technical debt accumulation when teams lack experienced guidance
    - Delivery delays when critical skills are missing

    Well-composed teams are more resilient, deliver more consistently, and
    provide better career development opportunities for all members.
  when_to_run:
  - During organizational planning cycles
  - When team performance metrics decline
  - Before major project kickoffs
  - After significant team changes (departures, reorgs)

signals:
  critical:
  - id: COMP-CRIT-001
    signal: Team has no senior technical leadership
    evidence_indicators:
    - No staff or senior engineers on team roster
    - All architecture decisions escalated outside team
    - Persistent quality issues in code reviews
    explanation: |
      Teams without senior technical leadership lack the experience to make
      sound architectural decisions, mentor junior engineers, and navigate
      complex technical challenges. This creates dependency on external
      resources and slows delivery significantly.
    remediation: Add senior engineering capacity through hiring or internal transfer
  high:
  - id: COMP-HIGH-001
    signal: Inverted experience pyramid
    evidence_indicators:
    - More senior than junior engineers
    - Limited growth opportunities for mid-level engineers
    - Expensive headcount with insufficient leverage
    explanation: |
      A top-heavy team structure indicates potential issues with career
      progression, cost efficiency, and succession planning.
    remediation: Rebalance team with junior hires and clear growth paths
  - id: COMP-HIGH-002
    signal: Single-skill concentration
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only one person knows critical technology
    - Code reviews bottleneck on specific individuals
    - Delivery stops when key person is unavailable
    explanation: |
      When critical skills are concentrated in individuals, the team becomes
      fragile and dependent on specific people's availability.
    remediation: Cross-train team members and distribute expertise
  medium:
  - id: COMP-MED-001
    signal: Insufficient mentorship capacity
    evidence_indicators:
    - High ratio of junior to senior engineers (>3:1)
    - Junior engineers report slow growth
    - Code review quality is inconsistent
    remediation: Adjust ratio or implement structured mentorship program
  - id: COMP-MED-002
    signal: Missing critical domain expertise
    evidence_indicators:
    - Team lacks expertise in key technology used
    - Frequent external consultations needed
    - Learning curve delays on projects
    remediation: Hire for missing expertise or invest in training
  low:
  - id: COMP-LOW-001
    signal: Homogeneous background distribution
    evidence_indicators:
    - All team members from similar educational backgrounds
    - Limited diversity in problem-solving approaches
    remediation: Consider diverse hiring for broader perspectives
  positive:
  - id: COMP-POS-001
    signal: Balanced experience distribution
    evidence_indicators:
    - Healthy mix of junior, mid, and senior engineers
    - Clear mentorship relationships
    - Multiple people can handle any critical task
