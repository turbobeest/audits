  what: |
    Bus factor analysis identifies critical knowledge dependencies where
    the loss of one or two individuals would significantly impact the
    organization's ability to:
    - Maintain and evolve systems
    - Respond to incidents effectively
    - Make key technical decisions
    - Continue normal operations

    This audit combines code analysis (commit history, code ownership),
    organizational data (on-call coverage, escalation paths), and
    interviews to identify single points of failure.
  why_it_matters: |
    Low bus factor creates existential risk for systems and teams:
    - Unexpected departures can halt critical projects
    - Incidents become crises when the only knowledgeable person is unavailable
    - Knowledge loss is permanent when undocumented
    - Remaining team members face impossible knowledge transfer burden

    Organizations with healthy bus factors are resilient to change
    and provide better work-life balance by not over-relying on individuals.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly as part of operational risk assessment
  - When key engineers announce departure
  - Before critical project phases
  - During succession planning

signals:
  critical:
  - id: BUS-CRIT-001
    signal: Bus factor of 1 for critical system
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only one person has committed to system in 6+ months
    - All incident escalations go to same person
    - No documentation exists for system
    explanation: |
      A bus factor of 1 means the loss of a single person would
      critically impair the organization's ability to maintain,
      troubleshoot, or evolve the system. This is unacceptable
      for any production system.
    remediation: Immediate knowledge transfer and documentation effort
  - id: BUS-CRIT-002
    signal: Single person holds organization-wide critical knowledge
    evidence_indicators:
    - One person is escalation target across multiple teams
    - Key architectural decisions require single individual
    - Infrastructure or security knowledge concentrated in one person
    explanation: |
      When critical cross-cutting knowledge is held by one person,
      the entire organization becomes vulnerable. This often happens
      with founding engineers or long-tenured specialists.
    remediation: Structured knowledge transfer program with documentation
  high:
  - id: BUS-HIGH-001
    signal: Bus factor of 2 or less for multiple critical systems
    evidence_indicators:
    - Fewer than 3 active contributors to critical repos
    - Same 2 people always handle certain types of incidents
    - Code reviews bottleneck on small group
    explanation: |
      While slightly better than bus factor of 1, a bus factor of 2
      still presents significant risk, especially if both individuals
      could be unavailable simultaneously (vacation, illness, departure).
    remediation: Cross-train additional team members in critical areas
  - id: BUS-HIGH-002
    signal: Key person has announced departure with no successor
    evidence_indicators:
    - Person leaving holds critical knowledge
    - No knowledge transfer plan exists
    - Replacement not yet identified or hired
    explanation: |
      Impending departure of key knowledge holder without succession
      plan will result in permanent knowledge loss.
    remediation: Immediate intensive knowledge transfer and documentation
  medium:
  - id: BUS-MED-001
    signal: Undocumented expertise concentration
    evidence_indicators:
    - Certain areas have informal 'owners' everyone relies on
    - Knowledge exists but isn't documented
    - New team members struggle to contribute in certain areas
    remediation: Document and share concentrated knowledge
  - id: BUS-MED-002
    signal: Review bottlenecks
    evidence_indicators:
    - Certain code reviews always wait for specific person
    - Some PRs blocked for days when reviewer unavailable
    remediation: Train additional reviewers, document review criteria
  low:
  - id: BUS-LOW-001
    signal: Historical knowledge concentration
    evidence_indicators:
    - Legacy code was written by one person, now maintained by team
    - Original author would be helpful but not required
    remediation: Continue gradual knowledge distribution
  positive:
  - id: BUS-POS-001
    signal: Healthy knowledge distribution
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple contributors to all critical systems
    - Any team member can handle common incidents
    - Documentation enables independent work
