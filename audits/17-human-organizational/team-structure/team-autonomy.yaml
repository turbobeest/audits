  what: |
    This audit examines the decision-making authority of engineering teams:
    - Technical decisions they can make independently
    - Approval gates and escalation requirements
    - Freedom to experiment and innovate
    - Ownership of their systems and processes

    It identifies barriers to autonomy that slow delivery and reduce
    team engagement.
  why_it_matters: |
    Low autonomy creates significant organizational drag:
    - Decision bottlenecks delay delivery
    - Engineers become disengaged when unable to decide
    - Innovation stalls when experimentation requires approval
    - Talented engineers leave for more autonomous environments

    High-performing organizations push decisions to teams closest to the work,
    enabling faster delivery and higher engagement.
  when_to_run:
  - During organizational health assessments
  - When delivery velocity is consistently slow
  - After engineering satisfaction surveys indicate concerns
  - During transformation initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: AUTO-CRIT-001
    signal: All technical decisions require external approval
    evidence_indicators:
    - Even minor changes require architecture review
    - No deploy authority without management signoff
    - Technology choices always dictated externally
    explanation: |
      Teams without decision authority are not empowered teams.
      This creates bottlenecks, disengagement, and inability to
      respond quickly to challenges.
    remediation: Establish clear decision rights pushing authority to teams
  high:
  - id: AUTO-HIGH-001
    signal: Excessive approval gates for routine changes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple approvals needed for standard deployments
    - Architecture review for minor technical decisions
    - Change advisory board for low-risk changes
    explanation: |
      Heavy approval processes for routine work slow delivery
      significantly without corresponding risk reduction.
    remediation: Streamline approvals based on change risk level
  - id: AUTO-HIGH-002
    signal: Teams cannot choose tools or approaches
    evidence_indicators:
    - All technology decisions made centrally
    - No ability to experiment with new approaches
    - Rigid standards without exception process
    explanation: |
      Denying teams any technology choice prevents context-appropriate
      decisions and inhibits innovation.
    remediation: Define boundaries with freedom within them
  medium:
  - id: AUTO-MED-001
    signal: Unclear decision rights
    evidence_indicators:
    - Uncertainty about what requires approval
    - Inconsistent escalation across similar decisions
    - Risk-averse behavior from unclear boundaries
    remediation: Document explicit decision rights per domain
  - id: AUTO-MED-002
    signal: Long approval timelines
    evidence_indicators:
    - Decisions wait days or weeks for approval
    - Approvers are bottlenecked
    - Work blocked waiting for decisions
    remediation: Set SLAs for approvals, reduce approver bottlenecks
  low:
  - id: AUTO-LOW-001
    signal: Approval processes not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Teams learn approval requirements by trial and error
    - Inconsistent guidance on when to escalate
    remediation: Document clear approval requirements and processes
  positive:
  - id: AUTO-POS-001
    signal: Healthy autonomy with appropriate guardrails
    evidence_indicators:
    - Teams make most decisions independently
    - Clear escalation criteria for high-impact decisions
    - Fast turnaround when approval is needed
    - Engineers feel empowered
