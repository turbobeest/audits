  what: |
    This audit maps the technical and domain skills present on engineering
    teams against the skills required to:
    - Build and maintain their owned systems
    - Respond to incidents and on-call situations
    - Evolve the technology stack appropriately
    - Onboard and train new team members

    It identifies gaps, concentrations, and areas needing investment.
  why_it_matters: |
    Skill coverage gaps create operational risk:
    - Systems become unmodifiable when no one understands them
    - Incidents escalate when on-call lacks relevant expertise
    - Technical debt grows when teams can't modernize
    - Velocity drops when external help is constantly needed

    Proactive skill coverage management enables resilient, capable teams
    that can independently own their systems end-to-end.
  when_to_run:
  - Annually during planning cycles
  - Before major technology migrations
  - When team ownership changes
  - After significant attrition

    purpose: Document technology landscape and required skills
signals:
  critical:
  - id: SKILL-CRIT-001
    signal: Zero coverage for critical production system
    evidence_indicators:
    - No team member can modify or debug specific system
    - Incidents in system require external escalation
    - System is in production but listed as 'legacy' with no owner
    explanation: |
      Systems without skill coverage become operational liabilities.
      They cannot be maintained, secured, or evolved. Incidents become
      emergencies requiring external intervention.
    remediation: Urgent skill transfer or system migration plan required
  high:
  - id: SKILL-HIGH-001
    signal: Single-person coverage for critical skill
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only one person rates as competent in technology
    - All related code reviews go to same person
    - Delivery blocks when person is unavailable
    explanation: |
      Single-person coverage creates bus factor risk and bottlenecks.
      The team is vulnerable to that person's availability.
    remediation: Cross-train second team member to competency
  - id: SKILL-HIGH-002
    signal: Major skill gap for primary technology
    evidence_indicators:
    - Team's main language/framework has low proficiency scores
    - Basic tasks take longer than expected
    - High error rate in code reviews
    explanation: |
      When teams lack proficiency in their core technologies, velocity
      suffers and quality degrades across all deliverables.
    remediation: Invest in training or bring in experienced hire
  medium:
  - id: SKILL-MED-001
    signal: Uneven skill distribution
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some areas have 5+ competent people, others have 1
    - Work allocation skewed to few individuals
    - Learning opportunities concentrated
    remediation: Rotate assignments to build broader coverage
  - id: SKILL-MED-002
    signal: Missing adjacent skill coverage
    evidence_indicators:
    - Team lacks observability skills for owned systems
    - No database expertise despite DB-heavy workload
    - Security reviews always require external help
    remediation: Identify and invest in key adjacent skills
  low:
  - id: SKILL-LOW-001
    signal: No formal skill assessment process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Skill levels are assumed, not documented
    - No regular skill review cadence
    remediation: Implement periodic skills assessment
  positive:
  - id: SKILL-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive skill coverage with redundancy
    evidence_indicators:
    - At least 2 people competent in each critical area
    - Clear development paths for building coverage
    - Regular skill review and investment process
