  what: |
    This audit examines on-call rotation practices to assess:
    - Rotation frequency and coverage adequacy
    - Load distribution fairness across team members
    - Skill coverage during on-call shifts
    - Escalation path effectiveness
    - Impact on engineer well-being and retention

    It identifies unsustainable patterns and gaps in incident response capability.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor on-call practices create multiple risks:
    - Burnout and attrition from unfair or excessive load
    - Incident response failures when skills don't match problems
    - Extended outages when escalation paths are unclear
    - Team morale issues from perceived unfairness

    Healthy on-call rotations enable reliable incident response while
    maintaining engineer quality of life and team sustainability.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly operational review
  - When on-call complaints increase
  - After team size changes significantly
  - Following major incident post-mortems

      # Analyze on-call distribution from schedule data
      # Input: CSV with columns date, oncall_primary, oncall_secondary
      import pandas as pd
      from collections import Counter

      def analyze_oncall(schedule_file):
          df = pd.read_csv(schedule_file)
          primary_counts = Counter(df['oncall_primary'])

          total_shifts = len(df)
          for person, count in primary_counts.most_common():
              pct = (count / total_shifts) * 100

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ONCALL-CRIT-001
    signal: Single person handles majority of on-call
    evidence_indicators:
    - One person assigned >50% of on-call shifts
    - No backup or secondary on-call
    - Person expresses burnout symptoms
    explanation: |
      Concentrating on-call burden on one person is unsustainable
      and creates extreme risk if that person becomes unavailable.
      This pattern often leads to burnout and attrition.
    remediation: Immediately redistribute on-call load and build team capacity
  - id: ONCALL-CRIT-002
    signal: No qualified on-call coverage for critical system
    evidence_indicators:
    - On-call rotation excludes people with critical system knowledge
    - Incidents consistently escalate to off-rotation experts
    - Resolution times extend due to skill mismatch
    explanation: |
      When on-call engineers lack skills for the systems they support,
      incidents become extended emergencies requiring escalation.
    remediation: Cross-train on-call engineers or restructure rotation
  high:
  - id: ONCALL-HIGH-001
    signal: Unsustainable on-call frequency
    evidence_indicators:
    - Engineers on-call more than 1 week per month
    - Rotation pool too small (<4 people)
    - No provisions for time off or swaps
    explanation: |
      High frequency on-call degrades quality of life, leads to fatigue,
      and increases error rates during incident response.
    remediation: Expand rotation pool or reduce on-call scope
  - id: ONCALL-HIGH-002
    signal: High page volume during off-hours
    evidence_indicators:
    - Average >5 pages per night shift
    - Pages are often actionable (not noise)
    - Sleep disruption is common
    explanation: |
      Frequent off-hours pages indicate system reliability issues
      that are being absorbed by engineers rather than fixed.
    remediation: Prioritize reliability improvements to reduce page volume
  medium:
  - id: ONCALL-MED-001
    signal: Uneven load distribution
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some engineers take 2x the on-call of others
    - New engineers excluded from rotation too long
    - Senior engineers bear disproportionate load
    remediation: Implement fair rotation algorithm with clear criteria
  - id: ONCALL-MED-002
    signal: Unclear escalation paths
    evidence_indicators:
    - On-call engineers unsure when/how to escalate
    - Escalation often goes to wrong person
    - No documented escalation criteria
    remediation: Document clear escalation paths and criteria
  - id: ONCALL-MED-003
    signal: No on-call compensation or recognition
    evidence_indicators:
    - On-call is uncompensated responsibility
    - No comp time or other recognition
    - Team members express resentment
    remediation: Implement fair compensation model for on-call burden
  low:
  - id: ONCALL-LOW-001
    signal: Manual schedule management
    evidence_indicators:
    - Schedules managed in spreadsheets
    - No automated swap or override process
    remediation: Adopt proper on-call scheduling tool
  positive:
  - id: ONCALL-POS-001
    signal: Healthy on-call practice
    evidence_indicators:
    - Even distribution across team
    - Sustainable frequency (<1 week/month)
    - Clear escalation paths
    - Fair compensation model
