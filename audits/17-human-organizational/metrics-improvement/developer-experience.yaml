description:
  what: |
    Assesses developer experience across multiple dimensions including
    flow state, cognitive load, and feedback loops (the DevEx framework).
    Evaluates tooling quality, development environment, build and test
    times, documentation, and overall developer satisfaction and productivity.
  why_it_matters: |
    Developer experience directly impacts productivity, quality, and
    retention. Research shows that developers in high-DevEx environments
    are 2x more productive and significantly less likely to leave.
    Poor DevEx creates friction, frustration, and accumulated technical
    debt as developers work around painful processes.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly developer satisfaction reviews
  - When productivity metrics decline
  - After significant tooling or process changes
  - During retention improvement initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEVEX-CRIT-001
    signal: Build times exceed 30 minutes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Developers report long wait times
    - Build metrics show > 30 min average
    - Developers avoid running builds
    explanation: |
      Long build times destroy feedback loops and flow state.
      Developers context-switch, lose focus, and productivity
      plummets. This is one of the highest-impact DevEx issues.
    remediation: Invest in build optimization, caching, incremental builds
  - id: DEVEX-CRIT-002
    signal: Developer environment setup takes more than 1 week
    evidence_indicators:
    - New hires can't code for days
    - Environment documentation is wrong or missing
    - Environment issues are common
    explanation: |
      Slow environment setup wastes new hire time and signals
      poor tooling investment. It's demoralizing and delays
      productivity.
    remediation: Automate environment setup; maintain setup documentation; provide dev containers
  high:
  - id: DEVEX-HIGH-001
    signal: Frequent interruptions prevent flow state
    explanation: Flow state is when developers do their best work; frequent interruption destroys productivity
    remediation: Establish no-meeting blocks; reduce alert noise; protect focus time
  - id: DEVEX-HIGH-002
    signal: Documentation is missing or unreliable
    explanation: Poor documentation forces developers to read code or interrupt others
    remediation: Invest in documentation; make it part of definition of done
  - id: DEVEX-HIGH-003
    signal: Developer satisfaction scores below 6/10
    explanation: Low satisfaction predicts attrition and reduced productivity
    remediation: Investigate specific pain points; prioritize DevEx investments
  medium:
  - id: DEVEX-MED-001
    signal: Test suite takes > 30 minutes to run
    remediation: Optimize tests; use parallelization; implement test selection
  - id: DEVEX-MED-002
    signal: Code review feedback takes > 24 hours
    remediation: Set review SLAs; implement review notifications
  low:
  - id: DEVEX-LOW-001
    signal: Minor tooling annoyances but workarounds exist
  positive:
  - id: DEVEX-POS-001
    signal: Developers report frequent flow state
  - id: DEVEX-POS-002
    signal: Build and test feedback in < 10 minutes
  - id: DEVEX-POS-003
    signal: Environment setup takes < 1 hour
  - id: DEVEX-POS-004
    signal: Developer satisfaction scores > 8/10
