description:
  what: |
    Assesses the quality metrics tracked including defect rates, escaped
    defects, test coverage, code quality scores, and customer-reported
    issues. Evaluates whether quality is measured systematically, how
    metrics are used to drive improvement, and whether quality is
    balanced against velocity.
  why_it_matters: |
    Quality metrics provide visibility into product health and engineering
    effectiveness. Without measuring quality, organizations can't know if
    they're improving or declining. Tracked quality metrics enable data-driven
    decisions about where to invest in prevention, testing, and process
    improvement.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly engineering assessments
  - When defect rates increase
  - After significant releases
  - During quality improvement initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: QUALITY-CRIT-001
    signal: No quality metrics tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No defect tracking
    - No test coverage measurement
    - Quality is anecdotal, not data-driven
    explanation: |
      Without quality metrics, organizations can't know if
      quality is improving or declining. Decisions about
      quality investment become guesses.
    remediation: 'Implement basic quality metrics: defect rate, escaped defects, test coverage'
  - id: QUALITY-CRIT-002
    signal: Escaped defect rate > 30%
    evidence_indicators:
    - Most defects found in production
    - Customer-reported bugs dominate backlog
    - Pre-production testing ineffective
    explanation: |
      High escaped defect rate indicates that quality gates
      aren't catching issues. This creates customer impact
      and expensive production debugging.
    remediation: Strengthen pre-production testing; add integration/E2E tests; improve code review
  high:
  - id: QUALITY-HIGH-001
    signal: Test coverage < 40%
    explanation: Low coverage means large portions of code are untested and risky
    remediation: Set coverage targets; require coverage for new code; add tests to critical paths
  - id: QUALITY-HIGH-002
    signal: Quality metrics trending worse over time
    explanation: Declining quality indicates unsustainable velocity or process problems
    remediation: Investigate root causes; allocate time for quality improvement
  medium:
  - id: QUALITY-MED-001
    signal: Quality metrics tracked but not acted upon
    remediation: Set quality targets; review metrics in retrospectives; tie to OKRs
  - id: QUALITY-MED-002
    signal: No definition of done includes quality criteria
    remediation: Add quality requirements to definition of done
  low:
  - id: QUALITY-LOW-001
    signal: Quality metrics not visible to all team members
  positive:
  - id: QUALITY-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive quality metrics tracked and improving
  - id: QUALITY-POS-002
    signal: Escaped defect rate < 10%
  - id: QUALITY-POS-003
    signal: Quality gates enforced in CI/CD
