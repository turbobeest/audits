description:
  what: |
    Assesses how team velocity is measured, interpreted, and used for
    planning and improvement. Evaluates whether velocity is understood
    as a planning tool (not a performance metric), whether comparisons
    across teams are avoided, and whether velocity is stable and predictable.
  why_it_matters: |
    Velocity, when properly used, enables predictable planning and helps
    teams identify improvement opportunities. When misused (as a performance
    metric, for cross-team comparison, or as a target), it creates perverse
    incentives, gaming, and burnout. Understanding proper velocity use is
    critical for sustainable delivery.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly agile health assessments
  - When planning accuracy declines
  - When observing velocity manipulation
  - During agile coaching reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: VELOCITY-CRIT-001
    signal: Velocity used as a performance metric for individuals
    evidence_indicators:
    - Individual velocity tracked or discussed
    - Velocity tied to performance reviews
    - Engineers report pressure to inflate points
    explanation: |
      Using velocity to measure individual performance creates
      gaming, point inflation, and destroys velocity's value
      for planning. It's a fundamental misuse of the metric.
    remediation: Stop individual velocity tracking immediately; educate on proper use
  - id: VELOCITY-CRIT-002
    signal: Cross-team velocity comparisons used for performance judgment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Teams ranked by velocity
    - Management asks why Team A is faster than Team B
    - Velocity used in team performance discussions
    explanation: |
      Velocity is relative to each team's estimation style and
      cannot be compared across teams. Comparing creates pressure
      to inflate and destroys planning utility.
    remediation: Stop cross-team comparisons; educate leadership on velocity purpose
  high:
  - id: VELOCITY-HIGH-001
    signal: Velocity targets set from above
    explanation: Imposed velocity targets create pressure that leads to inflation and burnout
    remediation: Remove targets; velocity is a planning tool, not a goal
  - id: VELOCITY-HIGH-002
    signal: Velocity highly unstable (> 30% variance)
    explanation: Unstable velocity undermines planning and indicates process problems
    remediation: Investigate causes of variance; improve estimation practices; address scope creep
  medium:
  - id: VELOCITY-MED-001
    signal: Velocity not used effectively for planning
    remediation: Train on using historical velocity for sprint commitment
  - id: VELOCITY-MED-002
    signal: Velocity inflation over time without productivity increase
    remediation: Re-baseline estimation; focus on outcomes not story points
  low:
  - id: VELOCITY-LOW-001
    signal: Minor inconsistency in story pointing
  positive:
  - id: VELOCITY-POS-001
    signal: Velocity used purely as a planning tool
  - id: VELOCITY-POS-002
    signal: Stable, predictable velocity enabling accurate planning
  - id: VELOCITY-POS-003
    signal: Leadership understands velocity is not for comparison
