description:
  what: |
    Assesses the effectiveness of feedback loops throughout the development
    lifecycle including technical feedback (build results, tests, linting,
    production monitoring) and human feedback (code reviews, retrospectives,
    performance reviews). Evaluates feedback speed, quality, and whether
    feedback actually drives improvement.
  why_it_matters: |
    Fast, high-quality feedback loops are essential for learning and
    improvement. DevEx research shows that feedback loop speed is one of
    the top three factors affecting developer productivity. Slow or
    low-quality feedback delays learning, allows problems to compound,
    and frustrates engineers.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly DevEx assessments
  - When development velocity declines
  - During CI/CD improvement initiatives
  - As part of engineering culture reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FEEDBACK-CRIT-001
    signal: Build feedback takes > 30 minutes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Developers wait long periods for build results
    - Build times exceed 30 minutes regularly
    - Developers avoid running builds due to time
    explanation: |
      Slow build feedback destroys flow state and forces context
      switching. Developers either wait (wasting time) or context
      switch (losing focus). This is one of the highest-impact
      DevEx issues.
    remediation: Invest in build optimization, incremental builds, remote caching
  - id: FEEDBACK-CRIT-002
    signal: No production monitoring feedback to developers
    evidence_indicators:
    - Developers don't see their code in production
    - No alerting on errors from new deployments
    - Production problems discovered by users first
    explanation: |
      Without production feedback, developers can't learn from
      real-world behavior of their code. Issues compound before
      they're discovered.
    remediation: Implement observability; give developers access to production metrics and logs
  high:
  - id: FEEDBACK-HIGH-001
    signal: Code review feedback takes > 24 hours
    explanation: Slow review feedback blocks progress and stales context
    remediation: Set review SLAs; reduce review load; automate style feedback
  - id: FEEDBACK-HIGH-002
    signal: Feedback is given but not actionable
    explanation: Vague feedback doesn't enable improvement
    remediation: Train on giving specific, actionable feedback; use feedback frameworks
  medium:
  - id: FEEDBACK-MED-001
    signal: Performance feedback only at annual reviews
    remediation: Implement regular 1:1s with developmental feedback
  - id: FEEDBACK-MED-002
    signal: CI feedback is noisy or flaky
    remediation: Reduce false positives; fix flaky tests; tune linting
  low:
  - id: FEEDBACK-LOW-001
    signal: Some feedback channels are underutilized
  positive:
  - id: FEEDBACK-POS-001
    signal: Build and test feedback in < 10 minutes
  - id: FEEDBACK-POS-002
    signal: Code review feedback within 4 hours
  - id: FEEDBACK-POS-003
    signal: Production metrics available immediately after deploy
  - id: FEEDBACK-POS-004
    signal: Regular, constructive feedback from managers
