description:
  what: |
    Assesses the organization's continuous improvement culture and practices
    including how improvements are identified, how they're prioritized against
    feature work, whether improvements are executed and measured, and whether
    there's a systematic approach to getting better over time.
  why_it_matters: |
    Continuous improvement is essential for long-term competitiveness and
    developer satisfaction. Organizations that continuously improve become
    more efficient and effective over time, while those that don't stagnate
    and accumulate process debt. Improvement is not automatic; it requires
    intentional practice and investment.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly engineering assessments
  - During strategic planning
  - When productivity is stagnating
  - As part of agile health checks

tooling:
  assessment_tools:
  - tool: Improvement tracking analysis
    purpose: Track improvement identification and completion rates
  - tool: Before/after measurement
    purpose: Measure outcomes of improvement initiatives
signals:
  critical:
  - id: IMPROVE-CRIT-001
    signal: No time or mechanism for improvement work
    evidence_indicators:
    - 100% of capacity goes to features
    - No improvement backlog or tracking
    - Engineers report no time to improve
    explanation: |
      Without time for improvement, organizations can only
      decline. Process debt accumulates, tools become outdated,
      and inefficiencies compound. This is unsustainable.
    remediation: Reserve capacity for improvement; track improvement work explicitly
  high:
  - id: IMPROVE-HIGH-001
    signal: Improvements identified but rarely implemented
    explanation: Identified but unactioned improvements breed cynicism
    remediation: Reduce improvement backlog; complete items before adding new ones
  - id: IMPROVE-HIGH-002
    signal: Improvement outcomes not measured
    explanation: Without measurement, you can't know if improvements worked
    remediation: Define success criteria before implementing; measure after
  medium:
  - id: IMPROVE-MED-001
    signal: Improvement is ad-hoc without systematic approach
    remediation: Implement regular improvement cycles; use Toyota Kata or similar
  - id: IMPROVE-MED-002
    signal: Improvements not shared across teams
    remediation: Create forums for sharing successful improvements
  low:
  - id: IMPROVE-LOW-001
    signal: Improvement tracking is inconsistent
  positive:
  - id: IMPROVE-POS-001
    signal: Regular capacity reserved for improvement work
  - id: IMPROVE-POS-002
    signal: Systematic improvement process with measurement
  - id: IMPROVE-POS-003
    signal: Improvements shared and adopted across teams
