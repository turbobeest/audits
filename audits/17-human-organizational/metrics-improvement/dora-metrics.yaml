  what: |
    Assesses the four key DORA metrics that predict software delivery
    performance: deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change
    failure rate, and mean time to recovery. Evaluates whether these
    metrics are tracked, understood, and used to drive improvement.
  why_it_matters: |
    DORA research spanning 7+ years and 30,000+ professionals shows that
    these four metrics strongly predict both organizational performance
    and employee satisfaction. Elite performers deploy on-demand (multiple
    times per day), with lead time < 1 hour, change failure rate < 15%,
    and MTTR < 1 hour. Organizations that don't measure can't improve.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly DevOps assessments
  - During continuous improvement initiatives
  - When delivery performance is questioned
  - Annually as part of engineering health review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DORA-CRIT-001
    signal: DORA metrics not tracked or unknown
    evidence_indicators:
    - Leadership cannot state deployment frequency
    - No data collection for DORA metrics
    - DORA metrics unfamiliar to team
    explanation: |
      Without measuring these fundamental metrics, organizations
      cannot assess their delivery capability or track improvement.
      You can't improve what you don't measure.
    remediation: Implement DORA metrics collection; start with deployment frequency and MTTR
  - id: DORA-CRIT-002
    signal: All four metrics at 'Low' performer level
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deployment frequency < monthly
    - Lead time > 1 week
    - Change failure rate > 45%
    - MTTR > 1 week
    explanation: |
      Low performance across all DORA metrics indicates severe
      delivery capability problems. This correlates with poor
      business outcomes and low developer satisfaction.
    remediation: Prioritize DevOps transformation; start with the most impactful metric
  high:
  - id: DORA-HIGH-001
    signal: Two or more metrics at 'Low' performer level
    explanation: Multiple low metrics indicate systemic delivery problems
    remediation: Focus improvement on one metric at a time; address root causes
  - id: DORA-HIGH-002
    signal: Metrics tracked but not used for improvement
    explanation: Vanity metrics that don't drive action provide no value
    remediation: Set DORA-based goals; review metrics in retrospectives; tie to OKRs
  medium:
  - id: DORA-MED-001
    signal: Metrics tracked inconsistently or manually
    remediation: Automate metrics collection; integrate with CI/CD and incident tools
  - id: DORA-MED-002
    signal: One metric significantly lags others
    remediation: Focus improvement efforts on the lagging metric
  low:
  - id: DORA-LOW-001
    signal: Metrics tracked at team level but not aggregated
  positive:
  - id: DORA-POS-001
    signal: All four metrics at 'High' or 'Elite' level
  - id: DORA-POS-002
    signal: DORA metrics automated and reviewed regularly
  - id: DORA-POS-003
    signal: Continuous improvement tied to DORA metrics
