description:
  what: |
    Assesses the deployment process from both technical and organizational
    perspectives. Examines deployment frequency, deployment autonomy (who
    can deploy), deployment coordination practices, rollback procedures,
    deployment windows, and the overall confidence and stress level
    associated with deployments. Evaluates whether deployments are routine
    non-events or high-stress ceremonies.
  why_it_matters: |
    DORA research consistently shows that deployment frequency is a key
    predictor of both organizational performance and developer satisfaction.
    Elite performers deploy multiple times per day with low stress, while
    low performers batch large releases that carry high risk. The ability
    to deploy frequently and safely depends on both technical capabilities
    and organizational factors like trust, ownership, and process clarity.

  - Quarterly DevOps assessments
  - After deployment incidents
  - When deployment frequency stalls
  - During CI/CD improvement initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEPLOY-CRIT-001
    signal: Deployments require manual coordination across multiple teams
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deployment meetings or ceremonies required
    - Multi-day deployment processes
    - Deployment windows of only a few hours per month
    explanation: |
      Manual coordination dramatically limits deployment frequency
      and creates high-stress batch releases that carry significant
      risk. This is a major barrier to continuous delivery.
    remediation: Invest in automation, feature flags, and service decoupling to enable independent deployment
  - id: DEPLOY-CRIT-002
    signal: No documented or tested rollback procedure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Team unsure how to roll back
    - Rollback not tested in last 6 months
    - Rollback requires manual database interventions
    explanation: |
      Without reliable rollback, every deployment is a high-stakes
      gamble. This creates deployment fear and reduces frequency.
    remediation: Document, automate, and regularly test rollback procedures
  high:
  - id: DEPLOY-HIGH-001
    signal: Deployment frequency less than weekly
    explanation: Low deployment frequency correlates with poor software delivery performance
    remediation: Identify and address blockers to more frequent deployment; consider continuous deployment
  - id: DEPLOY-HIGH-002
    signal: Deployments routinely cause production incidents
    explanation: High change failure rate indicates inadequate testing or deployment practices
    remediation: Improve pre-deployment validation, implement canary deployments, strengthen rollback
  - id: DEPLOY-HIGH-003
    signal: Only specific individuals can perform deployments
    explanation: Deployment bottlenecks limit velocity and create bus factor risk
    remediation: Democratize deployment capability with proper guardrails
  medium:
  - id: DEPLOY-MED-001
    signal: Deployment runbooks are outdated or incomplete
    remediation: Update runbooks; consider executable documentation
  - id: DEPLOY-MED-002
    signal: No deployment schedule or predictability
    remediation: Establish deployment cadence even if not fully continuous
  low:
  - id: DEPLOY-LOW-001
    signal: Deployment notifications go to too broad an audience
  positive:
  - id: DEPLOY-POS-001
    signal: Any engineer can deploy to production with automated guardrails
  - id: DEPLOY-POS-002
    signal: Deployments happen multiple times per day as routine events
  - id: DEPLOY-POS-003
    signal: Rollback is automated and regularly tested
