description:
  what: |
    Assesses the change management process covering how changes are
    classified, reviewed, approved, and tracked. Examines the balance
    between governance rigor and developer velocity. Evaluates whether
    the process scales appropriately with risk level or applies uniform
    overhead regardless of change scope.
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective change management protects production stability while
    enabling velocity. Overly bureaucratic processes slow delivery and
    encourage workarounds, while insufficient process leads to avoidable
    incidents. The best organizations use lightweight, risk-proportionate
    change processes that expedite routine changes while adding scrutiny
    for high-risk modifications.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly process reviews
  - After change-related incidents
  - When change approval becomes a bottleneck
  - Compliance preparation (SOC 2, ISO 27001)

    - How do you assess change risk?
    - What percentage of changes do you reject or request modification?
    - What would make the approval process more effective?
    purpose: Understand approver perspective and criteria
  - role: Security / Compliance

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CHANGE-CRIT-001
    signal: No change management process exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - Anyone can modify production without approval
    - No record of what changed when
    - Changes frequently cause incidents
    explanation: |
      Uncontrolled changes are a leading cause of production incidents.
      Without change management, there's no visibility into what's
      changing and no ability to correlate changes with problems.
    remediation: Implement lightweight change tracking; start with post-hoc change logging
  - id: CHANGE-CRIT-002
    signal: Change process is routinely bypassed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Emergency changes exceed normal changes
    - Developers describe workarounds as standard practice
    - Change records don't match actual deployment history
    explanation: |
      A bypassed process provides no protection. When the process is
      too burdensome, teams find workarounds that eliminate visibility.
    remediation: Simplify the process; ensure standard path is faster than workarounds
  high:
  - id: CHANGE-HIGH-001
    signal: All changes require same approval regardless of risk
    explanation: One-size-fits-all process either over-controls routine changes or under-controls risky
      ones
    remediation: Implement risk-based change classification with proportionate controls
  - id: CHANGE-HIGH-002
    signal: Change approval consistently takes more than 1 day
    explanation: Slow approval encourages batching, which increases risk
    remediation: Streamline approval for standard changes; pre-approve low-risk change types
  medium:
  - id: CHANGE-MED-001
    signal: Change classification criteria are unclear or subjective
    remediation: Document clear, objective criteria for each change category
  - id: CHANGE-MED-002
    signal: No post-implementation review of changes
    remediation: Add lightweight PIR for significant changes
  low:
  - id: CHANGE-LOW-001
    signal: Change records lack sufficient detail for audit
  positive:
  - id: CHANGE-POS-001
    signal: Standard changes are pre-approved and self-service
  - id: CHANGE-POS-002
    signal: Risk-based classification enables appropriate scrutiny
  - id: CHANGE-POS-003
    signal: Change process is automated and integrated into CI/CD
