description:
  what: |
    Examines the complete development workflow from task assignment through
    code merge. This includes branching strategy, commit practices, pull
    request workflows, code review gates, CI integration, and merge
    procedures. Evaluates both the documented process and actual team
    practices to identify friction points and improvement opportunities.
  why_it_matters: |
    An efficient development workflow directly impacts team velocity,
    code quality, and developer satisfaction. Poor workflows lead to
    context switching, merge conflicts, delayed feedback, and accumulated
    technical debt. Research from DORA shows that elite performers ship
    code to production multiple times per day with a change failure rate
    under 15%, enabled by streamlined workflows.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly team health assessments
  - After significant team growth (2x or more)
  - When cycle time metrics degrade
  - During DevEx improvement initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEVWF-CRIT-001
    signal: No defined branching strategy or workflow documentation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Missing CONTRIBUTING.md
    - Developers describe inconsistent practices
    - Chaotic branch naming without convention
    explanation: |
      Without a defined workflow, each developer invents their own
      process, leading to integration problems, lost work, and
      unpredictable delivery.
    remediation: Document and communicate a standard branching strategy (trunk-based, GitFlow, or GitHub
      Flow)
  - id: DEVWF-CRIT-002
    signal: PRs routinely blocked for more than 1 week
    evidence_indicators:
    - Average PR age > 7 days
    - Developers report review bottlenecks
    - PRs closed without merge due to staleness
    explanation: |
      Long-lived PRs accumulate merge conflicts, go stale, and
      demotivate developers. This is a leading indicator of
      delivery problems.
    remediation: Implement PR size limits, review SLAs, and consider async code review practices
  high:
  - id: DEVWF-HIGH-001
    signal: Large PRs (>500 lines changed) are common
    explanation: Large PRs are harder to review thoroughly and increase bug escape rate
    remediation: Encourage breaking work into smaller increments; use feature flags for partial deployments
  - id: DEVWF-HIGH-002
    signal: No CI checks run before merge
    explanation: Without automated validation, defects slip into main branch
    remediation: Implement required CI checks as branch protection rules
  medium:
  - id: DEVWF-MED-001
    signal: Inconsistent commit message formats
    remediation: Adopt conventional commits and enforce with commit-lint
  - id: DEVWF-MED-002
    signal: No PR template guiding review focus
    remediation: Create PR templates that prompt for testing steps, context, and screenshots
  low:
  - id: DEVWF-LOW-001
    signal: Developers manually run local tests inconsistently
  positive:
  - id: DEVWF-POS-001
    signal: Trunk-based development with feature flags enables continuous deployment
  - id: DEVWF-POS-002
    signal: PRs typically reviewed within 4 hours and merged same day
