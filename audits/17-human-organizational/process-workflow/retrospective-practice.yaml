description:
  what: |
    Assesses the effectiveness of team retrospectives including how
    frequently they occur, how well they're facilitated, whether all
    voices are heard, what actions emerge, and critically, whether
    those actions are actually completed. Evaluates retrospectives as
    a learning and improvement mechanism rather than just a ceremony.
  why_it_matters: |
    Retrospectives are the primary mechanism for team-level continuous
    improvement. Effective retrospectives surface problems early, build
    shared understanding, and drive incremental improvements. Ineffective
    retrospectives waste time, breed cynicism, and allow problems to
    fester. The difference between high-performing teams and others often
    lies in how well they learn and adapt through reflection.

    purpose: Measure retrospective satisfaction and psychological safety
signals:
  critical:
  - id: RETRO-CRIT-001
    signal: No retrospectives conducted in past 3 months
    evidence_indicators:
    - Team hasn't held a retro recently
    - Retros were cancelled repeatedly
    - Team reports not believing in retrospectives
    explanation: |
      Without retrospectives, teams lack a structured mechanism
      for reflection and improvement. Problems accumulate without
      being surfaced or addressed.
    remediation: Re-establish retrospective practice; start with simple formats
  - id: RETRO-CRIT-002
    signal: Team members report not feeling safe to speak in retros
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same few people always speak
    - Team members describe fear of consequences
    - Retros feel performative
    explanation: |
      Retrospectives without psychological safety are useless or
      harmful. They fail to surface real issues and can reinforce
      power dynamics that suppress honest feedback.
    remediation: Address psychological safety; consider anonymous input; use varied formats
  high:
  - id: RETRO-HIGH-001
    signal: Action items rarely completed (< 30% completion rate)
    explanation: Unactioned retrospectives breed cynicism and learned helplessness
    remediation: Reduce action item count; assign clear owners; follow up in subsequent retros
  - id: RETRO-HIGH-002
    signal: Same issues raised repeatedly without resolution
    explanation: Chronic unresolved issues indicate systemic blockers or insufficient authority
    remediation: Escalate recurring issues; involve leadership; address root causes
  medium:
  - id: RETRO-MED-001
    signal: Retrospectives follow same format every time
    remediation: Vary formats to maintain engagement and surface different perspectives
  - id: RETRO-MED-002
    signal: Retros focus only on negatives without celebrating wins
    remediation: Include positive reflection; use formats that balance criticism with appreciation
  low:
  - id: RETRO-LOW-001
    signal: Retrospective notes are not preserved or shared
  positive:
  - id: RETRO-POS-001
    signal: Action items consistently completed and visibly improve the team
  - id: RETRO-POS-002
    signal: All team members participate actively in discussions
  - id: RETRO-POS-003
    signal: Formats vary and engagement remains high
