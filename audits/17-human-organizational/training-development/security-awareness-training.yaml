description:
  what: |
    Assesses the security awareness and secure coding training program
    for engineering teams. Evaluates coverage of topics like secure
    coding practices, threat modeling, vulnerability awareness, incident
    response roles, and compliance requirements. Examines both initial
    training and ongoing reinforcement.
  why_it_matters: |
    Security vulnerabilities often originate from developer mistakes that
    could be prevented with proper training. Security awareness training
    reduces the attack surface by ensuring engineers understand common
    vulnerabilities, secure coding patterns, and their role in maintaining
    security. Many compliance frameworks require documented security
    training programs.

  - Annual security assessments
  - After security incidents

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SECTRN-CRIT-001
    signal: No security training program exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - Engineers report no security training
    - No security training materials
    - No training completion records
    explanation: |
      Without security training, engineers lack awareness of common
      vulnerabilities and secure coding practices. This dramatically
      increases the likelihood of security issues.
    remediation: Implement security training program covering OWASP Top 10 at minimum
  - id: SECTRN-CRIT-002
    signal: Security training not completed by majority of engineers
    evidence_indicators:
    - Completion rate < 50%
    - No enforcement of training requirements
    - Training seen as optional
    explanation: |
      Training that isn't completed provides no protection. Low
      completion rates indicate either poor prioritization or
      barriers to access.
    remediation: Make training mandatory; track completion; address barriers
  high:
  - id: SECTRN-HIGH-001
    signal: Training is outdated or doesn't cover current threats
    explanation: Security training must evolve with the threat landscape
    remediation: Update training annually; add modules for emerging threats
  - id: SECTRN-HIGH-002
    signal: No secure coding training specific to the tech stack
    explanation: Generic training misses language and framework-specific vulnerabilities
    remediation: Add training modules specific to languages and frameworks in use
  medium:
  - id: SECTRN-MED-001
    signal: Training is one-time without reinforcement
    remediation: Add periodic refresher training and ongoing security awareness activities
  - id: SECTRN-MED-002
    signal: No measurement of training effectiveness
    remediation: Implement knowledge assessments; track security incidents pre/post training
  low:
  - id: SECTRN-LOW-001
    signal: Security training is purely theoretical without hands-on exercises
  positive:
  - id: SECTRN-POS-001
    signal: All engineers complete security training with annual refreshers
  - id: SECTRN-POS-002
    signal: Hands-on secure coding labs included in training
  - id: SECTRN-POS-003
    signal: Security champions program reinforces training in each team
