description:
  what: |
    Assesses the mentorship infrastructure for engineers including formal
    mentorship programs, mentor-mentee matching, expectations and structure,
    and the broader culture of informal mentoring. Evaluates whether
    mentorship effectively accelerates development and spreads knowledge.
  why_it_matters: |
    Mentorship accelerates engineer development, improves retention, and
    spreads institutional knowledge. Junior engineers with mentors ramp
    up faster and stay longer. Senior engineers who mentor report higher
    job satisfaction. Without mentorship, knowledge silos form and new
    hires struggle to become effective.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual organizational assessments
  - When growing team rapidly
  - After identifying knowledge silos
  - As part of retention improvement initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MENTOR-CRIT-001
    signal: No mentorship support for new engineers
    evidence_indicators:
    - New hires have no assigned mentor or buddy
    - Junior engineers report feeling lost
    - No informal mentoring culture either
    explanation: |
      Without mentorship, new engineers struggle to become effective
      and are at high risk of leaving. Knowledge becomes siloed and
      the team fails to develop future senior engineers.
    remediation: Implement at minimum a buddy system for new hires; consider formal mentorship program
  high:
  - id: MENTOR-HIGH-001
    signal: Mentorship exists but is inconsistent across teams
    explanation: Inconsistent mentorship creates inequity and uneven development
    remediation: Standardize mentorship expectations across all teams
  - id: MENTOR-HIGH-002
    signal: Mentoring not recognized or rewarded
    explanation: Without recognition, mentoring competes unfairly with feature work
    remediation: Include mentoring in performance criteria; recognize contributions
  medium:
  - id: MENTOR-MED-001
    signal: Mentors receive no training or guidance
    remediation: Provide mentor training and resources
  - id: MENTOR-MED-002
    signal: Mentor-mentee matches made without consideration of fit
    remediation: Allow input on matching; consider goals and learning styles
  low:
  - id: MENTOR-LOW-001
    signal: Mentorship meetings happen irregularly
  positive:
  - id: MENTOR-POS-001
    signal: Formal mentorship program with structured expectations
  - id: MENTOR-POS-002
    signal: Mentoring recognized as part of senior engineer expectations
  - id: MENTOR-POS-003
    signal: Strong informal mentoring culture beyond formal program
