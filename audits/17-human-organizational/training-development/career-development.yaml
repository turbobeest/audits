description:
  what: |
    Assesses the career development infrastructure for engineers including
    documented career paths, leveling frameworks, growth opportunities,
    promotion processes, and individual development planning. Evaluates
    both the existence of these structures and their perceived fairness
    and effectiveness.
  why_it_matters: |
    Clear career development paths are critical for engineer retention
    and motivation. Without visible growth opportunities, talented
    engineers leave for organizations that invest in their futures.
    Well-designed career frameworks also ensure fair and consistent
    promotion decisions, reducing bias and improving morale.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual organizational assessments
  - After significant attrition
  - During compensation reviews
  - When starting to scale engineering team

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CAREER-CRIT-001
    signal: No documented career levels or growth path
    evidence_indicators:
    - No career ladder exists
    - Engineers unsure of next level expectations
    - Promotions seem arbitrary
    explanation: |
      Without a career framework, engineers can't see their future
      at the company. This leads to attrition as people seek
      clarity elsewhere. It also enables inconsistent and potentially
      biased promotion decisions.
    remediation: Develop and publish engineering career ladder with clear level expectations
  - id: CAREER-CRIT-002
    signal: No individual contributor (IC) track beyond senior level
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only path to advancement is management
    - Senior engineers have nowhere to grow
    - Technical leaders don't have commensurate titles/compensation
    explanation: |
      Forcing talented ICs into management to advance wastes their
      technical skills and often produces poor managers. A strong
      IC track retains technical talent and expertise.
    remediation: Create Staff/Principal/Distinguished IC levels with clear criteria
  high:
  - id: CAREER-HIGH-001
    signal: Promotion process is opaque or inconsistent
    explanation: Unclear promotion processes breed distrust and perceptions of favoritism
    remediation: Document promotion criteria and process; share with all engineers
  - id: CAREER-HIGH-002
    signal: No regular career development conversations
    explanation: Without regular discussion, career development doesn't happen
    remediation: Require quarterly career discussions between managers and reports
  medium:
  - id: CAREER-MED-001
    signal: Career ladder exists but isn't used consistently
    remediation: Train managers on using the framework; calibrate across teams
  - id: CAREER-MED-002
    signal: No lateral movement opportunities (e.g., team or specialty changes)
    remediation: Create internal mobility programs and encourage cross-team moves
  low:
  - id: CAREER-LOW-001
    signal: Career framework is complex or difficult to understand
  positive:
  - id: CAREER-POS-001
    signal: Clear career ladder with both IC and management tracks
  - id: CAREER-POS-002
    signal: Regular career conversations with documented development plans
  - id: CAREER-POS-003
    signal: Transparent promotion process with clear criteria
