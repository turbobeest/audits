description:
  what: |
    Assesses the organization's investment in external learning opportunities
    including conference attendance, training courses, certifications, books,
    and other professional development. Evaluates both the budget allocation
    and actual utilization of learning benefits.
  why_it_matters: |
    External learning opportunities expose engineers to new ideas, industry
    trends, and best practices from outside the organization. Conference
    attendance also provides networking opportunities and can improve
    employer brand for recruiting. Underinvestment in external learning
    leads to insularity and stagnation.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual budget reviews
  - During retention initiatives
  - When benchmarking benefits
  - As part of engineering culture assessments

signals:
  critical:
  - id: LEARN-CRIT-001
    signal: No learning budget or professional development support
    evidence_indicators:
    - No budget for conferences or training
    - Engineers pay out of pocket for learning
    - Requests for learning support routinely denied
    explanation: |
      Zero investment in external learning signals that the organization
      doesn't value engineer growth. This drives attrition and limits
      innovation.
    remediation: 'Establish per-engineer learning budget (typical: $2-5K/year)'
  high:
  - id: LEARN-HIGH-001
    signal: Learning budget exists but utilization is very low (<20%)
    explanation: Unused budget indicates barriers to access or lack of awareness
    remediation: Simplify approval process; actively encourage usage; lead by example
  - id: LEARN-HIGH-002
    signal: Learning budget well below industry standard
    explanation: Below-market benefits hurt retention and recruiting
    remediation: Benchmark against peers; increase budget to competitive level
  medium:
  - id: LEARN-MED-001
    signal: Approval process is complex or discouraging
    remediation: Streamline approval; pre-approve certain categories
  - id: LEARN-MED-002
    signal: No sharing of learnings after conferences or training
    remediation: Require trip reports or tech talks to share knowledge
  low:
  - id: LEARN-LOW-001
    signal: Budget doesn't roll over or is use-it-or-lose-it causing year-end rush
  positive:
  - id: LEARN-POS-001
    signal: Generous learning budget with high utilization
  - id: LEARN-POS-002
    signal: Simple, fast approval process for learning expenses
  - id: LEARN-POS-003
    signal: Knowledge sharing expected after external learning
