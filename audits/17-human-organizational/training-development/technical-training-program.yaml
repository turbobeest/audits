description:
  what: |
    Assesses the technical training program including onboarding training,
    ongoing skill development, access to learning resources, time allocated
    for learning, and the overall culture of continuous technical growth.
    Evaluates both formal training programs and informal learning support.
  why_it_matters: |
    Technical skills require continuous investment as technology evolves
    rapidly. Organizations that invest in training retain talent longer,
    innovate faster, and maintain code quality as standards evolve. Without
    structured training, skills stagnate, technical debt accumulates, and
    engineers leave for employers who invest in their growth.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual organizational assessments
  - After significant attrition
  - When skill gaps are identified
  - During engineering culture reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TRAIN-CRIT-001
    signal: No structured onboarding training for new engineers
    evidence_indicators:
    - New hires report being thrown into work without orientation
    - No onboarding documentation or curriculum
    - Time-to-productivity exceeds 3 months
    explanation: |
      Poor onboarding extends ramp-up time, frustrates new hires,
      and leads to early attrition. It also signals underinvestment
      in engineering capability.
    remediation: Develop structured onboarding program with technical and cultural components
  - id: TRAIN-CRIT-002
    signal: No budget or time allocated for ongoing learning
    evidence_indicators:
    - Engineers report no time for learning
    - Training budget is zero or nominal
    - Conference attendance not supported
    explanation: |
      Without investment in ongoing learning, skills stagnate and
      engineers feel undervalued. This is a leading indicator of
      attrition and technical decline.
    remediation: Allocate training budget (typically $2K-5K/engineer/year) and protected learning time
  high:
  - id: TRAIN-HIGH-001
    signal: Training exists but utilization is very low
    explanation: Unused training resources indicate barriers to access or lack of encouragement
    remediation: Identify and remove barriers; make learning time explicit; lead by example
  - id: TRAIN-HIGH-002
    signal: No training on company-specific systems and architecture
    explanation: Engineers struggle to be effective without understanding the codebase and systems
    remediation: Create internal training on architecture, systems, and conventions
  medium:
  - id: TRAIN-MED-001
    signal: Training is ad-hoc without structured curriculum
    remediation: Develop learning paths aligned with career levels and skill needs
  - id: TRAIN-MED-002
    signal: No measurement of training effectiveness
    remediation: Track training completion and correlate with performance outcomes
  low:
  - id: TRAIN-LOW-001
    signal: Learning resources are fragmented across multiple platforms
  positive:
  - id: TRAIN-POS-001
    signal: Engineers have dedicated learning time (10%+) protected on calendar
  - id: TRAIN-POS-002
    signal: Structured onboarding with clear milestones and checkpoints
  - id: TRAIN-POS-003
    signal: Internal knowledge sharing through tech talks and guilds
