  what: |
    This audit evaluates meeting practices:
    - Meeting necessity and purpose clarity
    - Preparation and agenda practices
    - Time management and punctuality
    - Decision capture and follow-up
    - Meeting load and distribution

    It identifies meeting waste and opportunities to improve
    meeting effectiveness or reduce meeting burden.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor meeting practices cause:
    - Significant time waste (often 30%+ of work time)
    - Fragmented calendars preventing deep work
    - Decisions made but not captured or followed up
    - Meeting fatigue and disengagement
    - Exclusion of those who can't attend

    Effective meetings have clear purpose, engage participants,
    and produce documented outcomes.
  when_to_run:
  - When meeting fatigue is reported
  - During productivity assessments
  - After organizational growth
  - When async communication is being improved

    purpose: Measure meeting time and distribution
signals:
  critical:
  - id: MTG-CRIT-001
    signal: Excessive meeting load
    evidence_indicators:
    - Engineers in meetings >50% of time
    - No blocks of deep work time available
    - Meeting fatigue widely reported
    explanation: |
      When meetings consume most of work time, there is no
      time for actual productive work. This is unsustainable.
    remediation: Audit and reduce meeting load aggressively
  high:
  - id: MTG-HIGH-001
    signal: Meetings without clear purpose
    evidence_indicators:
    - Standing meetings without agendas
    - Attendees unclear why they're there
    - Meetings to 'discuss' with no decision made
    explanation: |
      Meetings without purpose waste everyone's time and
      create calendar bloat without value.
    remediation: Require purpose and agenda for all meetings
  - id: MTG-HIGH-002
    signal: Decisions not captured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No meeting notes or action items
    - Same topics discussed repeatedly
    - Decisions forgotten or disputed
    explanation: |
      Without captured outcomes, meetings fail to create
      lasting value and must be repeated.
    remediation: Require documented outcomes for all meetings
