  what: |
    This audit evaluates escalation paths for:
    - Technical problems and blockers
    - Incident escalation during emergencies
    - Organizational and people issues
    - Cross-team coordination needs
    - Executive escalation for critical decisions

    It assesses whether people know how to escalate, escalation
    works in practice, and escalations are resolved effectively.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor escalation paths cause:
    - Extended incidents when help isn't reached
    - Festering problems that should have been escalated
    - Escalation anxiety preventing appropriate action
    - Unclear accountability for resolution
    - Issues ping-ponging without resolution

    Clear escalation paths enable rapid response to problems
    and appropriate engagement of decision-makers.
  when_to_run:
  - After incidents reveal escalation issues
  - During operational readiness review
  - When escalation complaints emerge
  - After organizational changes

  interviews:
  - role: Engineers
    questions:
    - Do you know how to escalate technical problems?
    - Have you escalated recently? How did it go?
    - Do you feel comfortable escalating when needed?
    - What would make escalation easier?
    purpose: Understand escalation from front line
  - role: Managers
    questions:
    - How do escalations come to you?
    - Are escalations appropriate in timing and severity?
    - How do you escalate to leadership?
    - What escalation challenges do you see?
    purpose: Management perspective on escalation
  - role: On-Call Engineers
    questions:
    - How do you escalate during incidents?
    - Are escalation paths clear during emergencies?
    - Have you had trouble reaching the right people?
    purpose: Emergency escalation effectiveness
  documents_to_review:

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ESC-CRIT-001
    signal: No escalation paths documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No escalation procedures exist
    - People don't know who to escalate to
    - Escalation is ad-hoc and inconsistent
    explanation: |
      Without documented escalation paths, escalations depend
      on tribal knowledge and relationships. This fails in
      emergencies and for new team members.
    remediation: Document clear escalation paths for all types
  - id: ESC-CRIT-002
    signal: Incident escalation fails in practice
    evidence_indicators:
    - Incidents where escalation didn't reach right people
    - Escalation contacts unreachable
    - Extended outages due to escalation failure
    explanation: |
      Escalation paths that don't work in practice lead to
      extended incidents and customer impact.
    remediation: Fix and test incident escalation paths
  high:
  - id: ESC-HIGH-001
    signal: Escalation anxiety prevents action
    evidence_indicators:
    - People hesitate to escalate fearing blame
    - Problems fester before escalation
    - Culture discourages 'bothering' others
    explanation: |
      When escalation is seen negatively, problems aren't
      surfaced until they become crises.
    remediation: Build culture that encourages appropriate escalation
  - id: ESC-HIGH-002
    signal: Escalations not resolved
    evidence_indicators:
    - Issues escalated but no action taken
    - Unclear who owns resolution after escalation
    - Issues bounce between people/teams
    explanation: |
      Escalation without resolution makes escalation futile
      and erodes trust in the process.
    remediation: Ensure clear ownership and accountability for escalations
  medium:
  - id: ESC-MED-001
    signal: Escalation paths outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Contacts have changed roles
    - Teams have been reorganized
    - Documentation not maintained
    remediation: Update escalation paths and maintain regularly
  - id: ESC-MED-002
    signal: Inconsistent escalation across teams
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different teams have different processes
    - Cross-team escalation unclear
    - No organization-wide standards
    remediation: Standardize escalation practices organization-wide
  low:
  - id: ESC-LOW-001
    signal: Escalation effectiveness not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No metrics on escalation response time
    - No tracking of escalation outcomes
    remediation: Track escalation metrics

  - id: ESC-POS-001
    signal: Clear and effective escalation paths
    evidence_indicators:
