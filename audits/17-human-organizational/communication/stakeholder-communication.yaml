  what: |
    This audit evaluates communication with non-engineering stakeholders:
    - Product management alignment
    - Business/leadership updates
    - Customer communication practices
    - Status and progress reporting
    - Technical translation for non-technical audiences

    It assesses whether engineering effectively communicates status,
    risks, and needs to stakeholders.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor stakeholder communication causes:
    - Misaligned priorities between engineering and business
    - Surprises when projects are delayed or fail
    - Technical debt accumulation from ignored risks
    - Eroded trust between engineering and stakeholders
    - Decisions made without engineering input

    Effective stakeholder communication ensures alignment,
    appropriate expectations, and informed decision-making.
  when_to_run:
  - When stakeholder relationship issues emerge
  - After project delivery problems
  - During cross-functional team assessments
  - Before major initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: STAKE-CRIT-001
    signal: No regular stakeholder communication
    evidence_indicators:
    - No status updates or reporting
    - Stakeholders unaware of engineering work
    - Major decisions made without engineering input
    explanation: |
      Without regular communication, stakeholders operate
      without visibility and engineering loses influence.
    remediation: Establish regular stakeholder communication cadence
  high:
  - id: STAKE-HIGH-001
    signal: Frequent stakeholder surprises
    evidence_indicators:
    - Delays or issues surprise stakeholders
    - Stakeholders learn about problems late
    - Expectations consistently misaligned
    explanation: |
      Surprises indicate communication is not surfacing
      important information appropriately.
    remediation: Improve proactive risk and status communication
  - id: STAKE-HIGH-002
    signal: Technical constraints not understood
    evidence_indicators:
    - Business requests ignore technical reality
    - Technical debt not visible to stakeholders
    - Capacity limitations not communicated
    explanation: |
      When stakeholders don't understand technical constraints,
      they make unrealistic requests and underinvest in maintenance.
    remediation: Improve translation of technical context for stakeholders
  medium:
  - id: STAKE-MED-001
    signal: One-way communication only
    evidence_indicators:
    - Updates sent but no discussion
    - Stakeholder input not gathered

    remediation: Create two-way communication opportunities
  - id: STAKE-MED-002
    signal: Inconsistent communication across teams
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some teams communicate well, others poorly
    - No organization-wide standards
    - Quality depends on individuals
    remediation: Establish stakeholder communication standards
  low:
  - id: STAKE-LOW-001
    signal: Communication effectiveness not measured
