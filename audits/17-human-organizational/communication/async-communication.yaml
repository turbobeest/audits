  what: |
    This audit evaluates asynchronous communication effectiveness:
    - Documentation-first communication practices
    - Async decision-making processes
    - Written communication quality
    - Timezone-aware practices
    - Balance of async vs sync communication

    It assesses whether teams can collaborate effectively without
    requiring real-time presence.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor async communication causes:
    - Blocking dependencies on people's availability
    - Exclusion of distributed team members
    - Interruption-heavy work environments
    - Decision delays waiting for meetings
    - Knowledge locked in synchronous conversations

    Effective async communication enables distributed teams, respects
    deep work, and creates better documentation as a side effect.
  when_to_run:
  - When distributed team challenges emerge
  - After team timezone expansion
  - When meeting fatigue is reported
  - During remote work transitions

    purpose: Measure time in meetings vs deep work
signals:
  critical:
  - id: ASYNC-CRIT-001
    signal: Work blocked without real-time availability
    evidence_indicators:
    - Tasks wait for meetings to progress
    - Decisions cannot be made without synchronous calls
    - Distributed members excluded from key discussions
    explanation: |
      When work requires real-time availability, distributed
      team members cannot contribute effectively, and everyone
      loses deep work time.
    remediation: Establish async-first decision-making processes
  high:
  - id: ASYNC-HIGH-001
    signal: Excessive meeting dependency
    evidence_indicators:
    - Calendars full of meetings
    - No documented meeting alternatives
    - Information shared only in meetings
    explanation: |
      Meeting-heavy cultures prevent deep work, exclude
      distributed members, and create information silos.
    remediation: Reduce meeting dependency with async alternatives
  - id: ASYNC-HIGH-002
    signal: Timezone exclusion patterns
    evidence_indicators:
    - Key meetings at inconvenient times for some
    - Distributed members miss important discussions
    - Certain timezones disadvantaged
    explanation: |
      When practices favor certain timezones, distributed
      team members become second-class participants.
    remediation: Rotate meeting times and document decisions async
  medium:
  - id: ASYNC-MED-001
    signal: Poor written communication quality
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unclear or incomplete written requests
    - Back-and-forth needed for clarification
    - People prefer to 'hop on a call' vs write
    remediation: Develop written communication skills and templates
  - id: ASYNC-MED-002
    signal: No async communication norms
    evidence_indicators:
    - No guidance on when to use what channel
    - Expectations for response times unclear
    - Inconsistent practices across teams
    remediation: Establish and document async communication norms
  low:
  - id: ASYNC-LOW-001
    signal: Async tools not fully utilized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Features like threads, reactions underused
    - Synchronous patterns in async tools
    remediation: Train on effective async tool usage
  positive:
  - id: ASYNC-POS-001
    signal: Effective async-first culture
    evidence_indicators:
    - Decisions made and documented async
    - Distributed members feel included
    - Meeting time is intentional and valuable
    - Good documentation as side effect
