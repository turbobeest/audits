  what: |
    This audit evaluates communication during incidents:
    - Internal incident coordination
    - Status page and external communication
    - Stakeholder notification
    - Post-incident communication
    - Communication templates and playbooks

    It assesses whether incidents are communicated effectively
    to reduce confusion and maintain trust.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor incident communication causes:
    - Confusion during response slowing resolution
    - Stakeholders surprised by customer reports
    - Customers losing trust from lack of updates
    - Internal chaos from unclear coordination
    - Repeated questions distracting responders

    Effective incident communication enables coordinated response,
    informed stakeholders, and maintained customer trust.
  when_to_run:
  - After incidents with communication issues
  - During incident response program review
  - Before major changes increasing incident risk
  - Quarterly operational review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: INC-CRIT-001
    signal: No incident communication process
    evidence_indicators:
    - No defined communication roles
    - No templates or playbooks
    - Communication ad-hoc during incidents
    explanation: |
      Without process, incident communication is chaotic,
      inconsistent, and often forgotten during response pressure.
    remediation: Establish incident communication process and roles
  - id: INC-CRIT-002
    signal: Customers learn about incidents from social media
    evidence_indicators:
    - Status page not updated
    - Customers report issues before company acknowledges
    - External communication delayed significantly
    explanation: |
      When customers learn about incidents from others before
      official communication, trust is severely damaged.
    remediation: Implement rapid external communication process
  high:
  - id: INC-HIGH-001
    signal: Internal communication chaos during incidents
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple conflicting updates
    - Unclear who is coordinating
