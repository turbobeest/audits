  what: |
    Assesses psychological safety within engineering teams using Edmondson's
    framework. Evaluates whether team members feel safe to take interpersonal
    risks including asking questions, admitting mistakes, proposing ideas,
    and challenging the status quo without fear of embarrassment, punishment,
    or negative career consequences.
  why_it_matters: |
    Google's Project Aristotle identified psychological safety as the most
    important factor in high-performing teams. Without psychological safety,
    engineers hide mistakes (leading to bigger failures), avoid asking
    questions (leading to poor decisions), and don't share innovative ideas
    (limiting improvement). Psychological safety is foundational to learning,
    innovation, and quality.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual team health assessments
  - After significant team changes
  - When observing symptoms of fear or silence
  - As part of engineering culture reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SAFETY-CRIT-001
    signal: Fear of speaking up is pervasive
    evidence_indicators:
    - Silence in meetings despite disagreement
    - Interviewees request anonymity to share concerns
    - Problems known but not discussed openly
    explanation: |
      When people fear speaking up, problems go unaddressed,
      decisions are made with incomplete information, and
      innovation is suppressed. This is a crisis-level cultural issue.
    remediation: Leadership must model vulnerability; address specific incidents; rebuild trust
  - id: SAFETY-CRIT-002
    signal: Mistakes are punished or blamed on individuals
    evidence_indicators:
    - Individuals fired or demoted for honest mistakes
    - Public blame in meetings or communications
    - Engineers afraid to take technical risks
    explanation: |
      Punitive response to mistakes drives fear, hiding, and
      risk aversion. It prevents learning and creates cover-up
      cultures that lead to larger failures.
    remediation: Institute blameless postmortems; focus on system improvements; protect mistake reporters
  high:
  - id: SAFETY-HIGH-001
    signal: Only senior voices are heard in discussions
    explanation: HiPPO (highest paid person's opinion) culture wastes junior talent and creates blind
      spots
    remediation: Actively solicit junior input; use structured discussion formats; rotate facilitation
  - id: SAFETY-HIGH-002
    signal: Questions framed as weakness
    explanation: When asking questions is risky, knowledge gaps persist and poor decisions follow
    remediation: Leaders model asking questions; celebrate learning over knowing
  medium:
  - id: SAFETY-MED-001
    signal: Psychological safety varies significantly across teams
    remediation: Identify and spread practices from safe teams; address specific managers
  - id: SAFETY-MED-002
    signal: Retrospectives are not honest or constructive
    remediation: Train facilitators; use anonymous input; address trust issues
  low:
  - id: SAFETY-LOW-001
    signal: Some discomfort with conflict, but issues do get raised
  positive:
  - id: SAFETY-POS-001
    signal: Team members freely admit mistakes and ask for help
  - id: SAFETY-POS-002
    signal: Dissenting opinions are welcomed and explored
  - id: SAFETY-POS-003
    signal: Junior engineers actively participate in discussions
  - id: SAFETY-POS-004
    signal: Leaders model vulnerability by sharing their own mistakes
