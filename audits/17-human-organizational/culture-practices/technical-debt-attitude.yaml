description:
  what: |
    Assesses the organizational attitude and practices around technical
    debt. Evaluates how technical debt is identified, tracked, communicated
    to stakeholders, and prioritized against feature work. Examines whether
    teams have authority and time to address debt, and whether leadership
    understands and supports debt reduction.
  why_it_matters: |
    Technical debt, if unmanaged, accumulates interest that slows all
    future development. Organizations that ignore technical debt eventually
    reach a point where progress becomes extremely difficult. The attitude
    toward debt determines whether it's managed proactively or allowed to
    compound until it creates crises.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly engineering health assessments
  - When velocity is declining
  - After outages caused by legacy code
  - During strategic planning

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEBT-CRIT-001
    signal: Technical debt is not acknowledged or tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No debt tracking system
    - Leadership unaware of debt levels
    - Engineers report debt but no visibility upward
    explanation: |
      Untracked debt is unmanaged debt. Without visibility, debt
      accumulates silently until it creates crises. Leadership
      can't make informed prioritization decisions.
    remediation: Implement technical debt tracking; regularly report debt status to leadership
  - id: DEBT-CRIT-002
    signal: Zero time allocated to debt reduction
    evidence_indicators:
    - 100% capacity committed to features
    - Debt items never prioritized
    - Engineers forbidden from fixing underlying issues
    explanation: |
      Without time to address debt, it compounds indefinitely.
      Eventually the codebase becomes unmaintainable and velocity
      drops to near zero.
    remediation: Reserve 15-20% of capacity for debt reduction; make it non-negotiable
  high:
  - id: DEBT-HIGH-001
    signal: Debt is tracked but consistently deprioritized
    explanation: Tracked but ignored debt provides visibility without action
    remediation: Set debt reduction goals; tie debt metrics to OKRs; escalate persistent debt
  - id: DEBT-HIGH-002
    signal: Engineers feel disempowered to address debt
    explanation: When engineers can't fix problems they see, frustration and attrition follow
    remediation: Empower teams to address debt; provide protected capacity
  medium:
  - id: DEBT-MED-001
    signal: Debt is discussed but not quantified
    remediation: Quantify debt in terms of time cost or risk; make it concrete
  - id: DEBT-MED-002
    signal: Debt reduction is individual heroics, not systematic
    remediation: Make debt reduction a team responsibility; plan debt sprints
  low:
  - id: DEBT-LOW-001
    signal: Debt tracking exists but categorization is inconsistent
  positive:
  - id: DEBT-POS-001
    signal: Regular time dedicated to debt reduction (15-20%)
  - id: DEBT-POS-002
    signal: Technical debt is visible and discussed at leadership level
  - id: DEBT-POS-003
    signal: Debt levels are stable or declining over time
