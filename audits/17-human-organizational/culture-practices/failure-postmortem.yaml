description:
  what: |
    Assesses the organization's culture around failure and learning,
    focusing on postmortem practices. Evaluates whether failures are
    treated as learning opportunities or causes for blame, whether
    postmortems are conducted blamelessy, whether action items are
    completed, and whether learning is shared broadly.
  why_it_matters: |
    Organizations that learn from failure become more resilient over
    time. Blameless postmortems surface root causes that would otherwise
    remain hidden. Blame-oriented cultures drive fear, hiding, and
    repeated failures. The difference between high-reliability organizations
    and others is fundamentally about how they treat failure.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly SRE assessments
  - After major incidents
  - When observing repeated failures

signals:
  critical:
  - id: POSTMORTEM-CRIT-001
    signal: Individuals are blamed or punished for failures
    evidence_indicators:
    - Named individuals in postmortems as root cause
    - Disciplinary action following incidents
    - Engineers afraid to admit mistakes
    explanation: |
      Blame culture suppresses learning and drives cover-ups.
      When people fear punishment, they hide problems, leading
      to larger failures. This is fundamentally incompatible
      with high reliability.
    remediation: Institute strict blameless postmortem policy; leadership must model and enforce
  - id: POSTMORTEM-CRIT-002
    signal: No postmortems conducted after significant failures
    evidence_indicators:
    - Incidents closed without review
    - No postmortem records found
    - Same incidents recur without analysis
    explanation: |
      Without postmortems, failures repeat. Organizations that
      don't learn from incidents are doomed to repeat them with
      increasing severity.
    remediation: Mandate postmortems for all significant incidents; protect time for learning
  high:
  - id: POSTMORTEM-HIGH-001
    signal: Postmortems conducted but action items not completed
    explanation: Postmortems without follow-through are theater; same failures recur
    remediation: Track action items rigorously; review completion; escalate blockers
  - id: POSTMORTEM-HIGH-002
    signal: Postmortems are not shared or learning not disseminated
    explanation: Local learning without sharing limits organizational improvement
    remediation: Share postmortems broadly; create learning repositories; discuss in team meetings
  medium:
  - id: POSTMORTEM-MED-001
    signal: Postmortems focus on technical fixes without process/cultural factors
    remediation: Include contributing factors and broader context in postmortem template
  - id: POSTMORTEM-MED-002
    signal: Postmortems take too long to complete (> 2 weeks)
    remediation: Set timeline expectations; simplify process; assign clear owner
  low:
  - id: POSTMORTEM-LOW-001
    signal: Postmortem format varies without standard template
  positive:
  - id: POSTMORTEM-POS-001
    signal: Blameless postmortems conducted for all significant incidents
  - id: POSTMORTEM-POS-002
    signal: Action items from postmortems consistently completed
  - id: POSTMORTEM-POS-003
    signal: Postmortems shared broadly and learnings disseminated
  - id: POSTMORTEM-POS-004
    signal: Failure discussed openly without fear
