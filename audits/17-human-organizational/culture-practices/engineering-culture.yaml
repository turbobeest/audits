description:
  what: |
    Assesses the overall engineering culture including stated values vs.
    lived values, collaboration patterns, autonomy and ownership, how
    decisions are made, how quality is prioritized, work-life balance,
    and the overall environment for engineers. Evaluates both explicit
    cultural artifacts and implicit cultural norms.
  why_it_matters: |
    Engineering culture determines whether talented engineers thrive or
    leave. Strong cultures attract and retain talent, enable high
    performance, and drive innovation. Dysfunctional cultures create
    churn, reduce productivity, and accumulate technical debt as short-term
    thinking dominates. Culture is the foundation on which all other
    engineering practices are built.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual organizational health assessments
  - After significant leadership changes
  - When experiencing high attrition
  - During major transformation initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CULTURE-CRIT-001
    signal: Blame culture dominates incident response and failure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Individuals blamed for system failures
    - Fear of admitting mistakes
    - Cover-ups of problems
    explanation: |
      Blame culture suppresses learning, drives out good engineers,
      and creates incentives for hiding problems. This leads to
      larger failures and toxic work environment.
    remediation: Adopt blameless postmortems; focus on system failures not individuals
  - id: CULTURE-CRIT-002
    signal: Chronic overwork is normalized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Regular evenings and weekends expected
    - PTO discouraged or unused
    - Burnout is widespread
    explanation: |
      Chronic overwork leads to burnout, errors, and attrition.
      It signals management failure to prioritize or resource
      appropriately. Sustainable pace produces better outcomes.
    remediation: Set and enforce work hour expectations; address root causes of overwork
  high:
  - id: CULTURE-HIGH-001
    signal: Large gap between stated values and lived experience
    explanation: Hypocritical values breed cynicism and distrust
    remediation: Either change values to match reality or change reality to match values
  - id: CULTURE-HIGH-002
    signal: Engineers have little autonomy or ownership
    explanation: Micromanagement demotivates and slows delivery
    remediation: Push decisions to teams; define outcomes not methods
  - id: CULTURE-HIGH-003
    signal: Quality consistently sacrificed for speed
    explanation: Short-term thinking accumulates technical debt and burnout
    remediation: Make quality a first-class priority; track quality metrics alongside velocity
  medium:
  - id: CULTURE-MED-001
    signal: Siloed teams with poor cross-team collaboration
    remediation: Create cross-team forums; encourage mobility; align incentives
  - id: CULTURE-MED-002
    signal: No documented engineering principles or values
    remediation: Collaboratively develop and document engineering principles
  low:
  - id: CULTURE-LOW-001
    signal: Inconsistent culture across different teams
  positive:
  - id: CULTURE-POS-001
    signal: Engineers report high autonomy and ownership
  - id: CULTURE-POS-002
    signal: Blameless culture enables learning from failures
  - id: CULTURE-POS-003
    signal: Work-life balance is protected and respected
  - id: CULTURE-POS-004
    signal: Quality is prioritized alongside delivery speed
