description:
  what: |
    Assesses whether engineers have dedicated time for innovation,
    experimentation, and self-directed projects. Evaluates policies
    like 20% time, hack days, or innovation sprints, and more importantly,
    whether these policies are actually used and valued. Examines outcomes
    of innovation time to assess effectiveness.
  why_it_matters: |
    Dedicated innovation time enables engineers to explore new technologies,
    solve problems creatively, and develop ideas that wouldn't emerge from
    backlog-driven work. Many significant innovations (Gmail, Slack, etc.)
    emerged from engineer-driven exploration. Without innovation time,
    organizations optimize for short-term delivery at the cost of long-term
    improvement.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual engineering culture assessments
  - When innovation output is low
  - During strategic planning
  - As part of retention initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: INNOV-CRIT-001
    signal: No time for anything beyond immediate delivery
    evidence_indicators:
    - 100% of time committed to sprint work
    - Engineers report no capacity for experimentation
    - Innovation time policy exists but is never used
    explanation: |
      When there's no slack for innovation, organizations optimize
      purely for short-term delivery. This leads to stagnation,
      talent attrition, and missed opportunities for improvement.
    remediation: Create protected innovation time; reduce sprint commitments; run hack days
  high:
  - id: INNOV-HIGH-001
    signal: Innovation time exists in policy but not in practice
    explanation: Theoretical time that can't be used provides no benefit
    remediation: Make innovation time mandatory; protect it on calendars; remove guilt
  - id: INNOV-HIGH-002
    signal: Innovation outcomes are never adopted or valued
    explanation: If innovation projects go nowhere, the time is wasted and cynicism grows
    remediation: Create path from innovation to production; celebrate successful innovations
  medium:
  - id: INNOV-MED-001
    signal: Innovation time is inconsistent across teams
    remediation: Standardize innovation time policy; ensure equitable access
  - id: INNOV-MED-002
    signal: No structure or support for innovation time
    remediation: Provide themes, resources, and showcase opportunities
  low:
  - id: INNOV-LOW-001
    signal: Innovation time is individual-only without collaboration
  positive:
  - id: INNOV-POS-001
    signal: Regular hack days with high participation and visible outcomes
  - id: INNOV-POS-002
    signal: Engineers routinely use innovation time for exploration
  - id: INNOV-POS-003
    signal: Production features can be traced back to innovation projects
