  what: |
    This audit evaluates token supply dynamics including inflation
    and deflation mechanisms. It examines:
    - Emission schedule and rate
    - Burn mechanisms
    - Supply cap enforcement
    - Inflation rate calculation
    - Deflation triggers
    - Supply predictability
  why_it_matters: |
    Supply dynamics affect token value:
    - High inflation dilutes holders
    - Deflationary spirals harm adoption
    - Unpredictable supply creates uncertainty
    - Burn mechanisms affect long-term supply
    - Emission schedules impact participation

    Balanced supply management supports protocol health.
  when_to_run:
  - Token design
  - Monetary policy review
  - Emission analysis
  - Long-term planning

signals:
  high:
  - id: INFL-HIGH-001
    signal: Inflation rate unsustainably high
    evidence_indicators:
    - Annual inflation > 20%
    - Emission exceeds ecosystem growth
    - Constant selling pressure
    explanation: |
      High inflation creates persistent sell pressure as recipients
      convert emissions to other assets.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce emission rate
      - Implement halving schedule
      - Tie emissions to protocol metrics
      - Add burn mechanisms
  - id: INFL-HIGH-002
    signal: Deflationary death spiral risk
    evidence_indicators:
    - Burns trigger more burns
    - Deflation discourages spending
    - Holding rewarded over using
    explanation: |
      Excessive deflation can create death spirals where reduced
      usage triggers more deflation.
    remediation: |
      - Balance burn with emission
      - Avoid excessive deflation
      - Maintain usage incentives
      - Cap burn rate
  medium:
  - id: INFL-MED-001
    signal: Supply unpredictable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Emission rate variable
    - Burns unpredictable
    - Supply forecasting difficult
    explanation: |
      Unpredictable supply creates uncertainty for holders and
      makes planning difficult.
    remediation: |
      - Define predictable emission schedule
      - Document supply projections
      - Make burns predictable
      - Provide supply tracking
  - id: INFL-MED-002
    signal: Burn mechanism can be gamed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Burn triggers manipulable
    - Artificial burns possible
    - Burn value extraction possible
    explanation: |
      Manipulable burn mechanisms can be exploited to artificially
      reduce supply or extract value.
    remediation: |
      - Make burns automatic
      - Tie burns to protocol activity
      - Prevent artificial burns
      - Monitor burn patterns
  low:
  - id: INFL-LOW-001
    signal: Supply dynamics not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Emission schedule unclear
    - Burn conditions unknown
    - Supply projections missing
    explanation: |
      Undocumented supply dynamics prevent informed investment
      decisions.
    remediation: |
      - Document emission schedule
      - Explain burn conditions
      - Provide supply projections
      - Show historical supply
  - id: INFL-LOW-002
    signal: No supply monitoring
    evidence_indicators:
    - Supply not tracked
    - Inflation rate not displayed
    - Burn history unavailable
    explanation: |
      Without supply monitoring, participants cannot track
      monetary policy effects.
    remediation: |
      - Display current supply
      - Track inflation rate
      - Show burn statistics
      - Provide supply dashboard
  positive:
  - id: INFL-POS-001
    signal: Balanced supply dynamics
    evidence_indicators:
    - Sustainable emission rate
    - Healthy burn mechanism
    - Predictable supply
