  what: |
    This audit evaluates the token economic model for sustainability
    and attack resistance. It examines:
    - Value accrual mechanisms
    - Supply and demand dynamics
    - Fee structure sustainability
    - Yield/reward calculations
    - Economic attack vectors
    - Long-term sustainability
  why_it_matters: |
    Economic model determines protocol sustainability:
    - Flawed economics leads to collapse
    - Unsustainable yields are ponzi-like
    - Poor fee design harms adoption
    - Attack vectors extract value
    - Token value reflects model quality

    Sound economics are essential for protocol longevity.

  - Protocol design
  - Tokenomics review
  - Sustainability assessment

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ECON-CRIT-001
    signal: Yield not sustainable
    evidence_indicators:
    - High yield with no revenue source
    - Yields paid from principal
    - Ponzi-like structure
    explanation: |
      Unsustainable yields require constant new capital inflow.
      When inflows stop, the system collapses.
    remediation: |
      - Identify yield source
      - Ensure yields from real revenue
      - Model long-term sustainability
      - Warn users of risks
    cwe: CWE-682
  - id: ECON-CRIT-002
    signal: Economic death spiral possible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Price decline triggers selling
    - Liquidation cascades possible
    - Negative feedback loops
    explanation: |
      Death spirals occur when price decline triggers more
      selling, creating unstoppable collapse.
    remediation: |
      - Analyze feedback loops
      - Add circuit breakers
      - Limit cascade potential
      - Design for stability
  high:
  - id: ECON-HIGH-001
    signal: Fee extraction excessive
    evidence_indicators:
    - High protocol fees
    - Hidden fee mechanisms
    - Fees harm user economics
    explanation: |
      Excessive fees extract value from users, harming adoption
      and creating negative perception.
    remediation: |
      - Benchmark fees against alternatives
      - Make fees transparent
      - Align fees with value provided
      - Consider fee caps
  - id: ECON-HIGH-002
    signal: Value leakage to extractors
    evidence_indicators:
    - MEV extraction significant
    - Arbitrage profits excessive
    - User value lost to bots
    explanation: |
      Value leakage to MEV extractors and arbitrageurs reduces
      value captured by protocol and users.
    remediation: |
      - Implement MEV protection
      - Design MEV-resistant mechanisms
      - Internalize extractable value
      - Use private transactions
  medium:
  - id: ECON-MED-001
    signal: Token utility unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - Token not required for protocol
    - Weak value accrual
    - Utility not compelling
    explanation: |
      Tokens without clear utility struggle to maintain value
      and may be deemed securities.
    remediation: |
      - Define clear utility
      - Require token for protocol use
      - Implement value accrual
      - Document utility
  - id: ECON-MED-002
    signal: Inflation rate too high
    evidence_indicators:
    - Emission exceeds demand
    - Constant sell pressure
    - Dilution harms holders
    explanation: |
      High inflation creates constant sell pressure as recipients
      convert tokens to other assets.
    remediation: |
      - Model inflation impact
      - Balance emissions with demand
      - Consider decreasing emissions
      - Add burn mechanisms
  low:
  - id: ECON-LOW-001
    signal: Economic model not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No tokenomics documentation
    - Fee structure unclear
    - Model not explained
    explanation: |
      Undocumented economics create uncertainty and reduce
      ability to analyze model soundness.
    remediation: |
      - Document economic model
      - Explain value flows
      - Publish fee structure
      - Provide model simulations
  positive:
  - id: ECON-POS-001
    signal: Sound economic model

    - Clear utility
    - Balanced incentives
