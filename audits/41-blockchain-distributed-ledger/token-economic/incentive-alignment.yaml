  what: |
    This audit evaluates whether protocol incentives align
    participant behavior with protocol health. It examines:
    - Validator/miner incentive alignment
    - User behavior incentives
    - Governance participant alignment
    - Short vs. long-term incentive balance
    - Gaming and exploitation vectors
    - Principal-agent problems
  why_it_matters: |
    Misaligned incentives cause protocol failure:
    - Rational actors exploit misalignments
    - Validators may act against users
    - Short-term thinking harms protocol
    - Gaming undermines mechanism goals
    - Aligned incentives are self-sustaining

    Correct incentive design is essential for protocol success.
  when_to_run:
  - Protocol design
  - Mechanism review
  - After exploitation
  - Governance design

signals:
  critical:
  - id: INCENT-CRIT-001
    signal: Rational behavior harms protocol
    evidence_indicators:
    - Profit maximizing harms users
    - Validator incentives misaligned
    - Gaming is profitable
    explanation: |
      When rational self-interest harms the protocol, participants
      will exploit this, leading to degradation or failure.
    remediation: |
      - Realign incentives with protocol goals
      - Penalize harmful behavior
      - Reward beneficial behavior
      - Game theory analysis
    cwe: CWE-840
  - id: INCENT-CRIT-002
    signal: Sybil attacks profitable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple accounts increase rewards
    - Splitting stakes is beneficial
    - Identity manipulation profitable
    explanation: |
      Sybil-profitable incentives encourage manipulation and
      concentration by sophisticated actors.
    remediation: |
      - Make splitting unprofitable
      - Add sybil resistance
      - Use sublinear rewards
      - Verify unique participation
  high:
  - id: INCENT-HIGH-001
    signal: Short-term incentives dominate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Quick profits over sustainability
    - No long-term alignment
    - Mercenary capital encouraged
    explanation: |
      Short-term focus leads to extraction over contribution,
      harming long-term protocol health.
    remediation: |
      - Add lock-up requirements
      - Boost long-term rewards
      - Penalize short-term extraction
      - Implement time-weighted rewards
  - id: INCENT-HIGH-002
    signal: Governance capture possible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Vote buying profitable
    - Governance rewards misaligned
    - Attackers benefit from bad votes
    explanation: |
      When governance participation can be captured through
      bribery or concentration, protocol control is at risk.
    remediation: |
      - Make vote buying unprofitable
      - Implement conviction voting
      - Add governance delays
      - Distribute voting power
  medium:
  - id: INCENT-MED-001
    signal: Free rider problem
    evidence_indicators:
    - Non-participants benefit equally
    - Contribution not rewarded
    - Passive holding advantaged
    explanation: |
      Free rider problems discourage active participation
      needed for protocol health.
    remediation: |
      - Reward active participation
      - Dilute passive holders
      - Require contribution for rewards
      - Design participation incentives
  - id: INCENT-MED-002
    signal: Information asymmetry exploitable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Insiders have advantage
    - Information not public
    - Front-running profitable
    explanation: |
      Information asymmetry allows informed parties to extract
      value from uninformed participants.
    remediation: |
      - Make information public
      - Reduce information advantages
      - Implement fair ordering
      - Add transparency mechanisms
  low:
  - id: INCENT-LOW-001
    signal: Incentives not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reward mechanism unclear
    - Penalty structure unknown
    - Participant guidance missing
    explanation: |
      Undocumented incentives prevent participants from making
      informed decisions.
    remediation: |
      - Document all incentives
      - Explain reward calculations
      - Describe penalty conditions
      - Provide participation guides
  positive:
  - id: INCENT-POS-001
    signal: Well-aligned incentives
    evidence_indicators:
    - Rational behavior benefits protocol
    - Long-term alignment
    - Gaming unprofitable
