  what: |
    This audit evaluates how easily documentation can be discovered through
    search functionality. The audit examines search effectiveness, content
    tagging, metadata quality, and search analytics to identify discoverability
    improvements.
  why_it_matters: |
    Most users find documentation through search rather than navigation.
    Poor search discoverability means content exists but can't be found,
    wasting the effort of creating it. Good discoverability enables self-
    service information access and reduces repetitive questions.
  when_to_run:
  - During documentation platform evaluations
  - When users report difficulty finding information
  - After major content reorganization
  - During knowledge management reviews

    purpose: Analyze search patterns and failures
  - method: Content audit
    purpose: Check metadata and tagging
signals:
  critical:
  - id: SEARCH-CRIT-001
    signal: Search functionality doesn't exist or is broken
    evidence_indicators:
    - No search feature available
    - Search returns no results
    - Search is extremely slow
    explanation: |
      Without functional search, users must navigate manually,
      which is slow and often unsuccessful.
    remediation: Implement or fix search functionality
  high:
  - id: SEARCH-HIGH-001
    signal: Search results are irrelevant
    evidence_indicators:
    - Top results don't match query intent
    - Relevant content buried in results
    - Users report not finding expected content
    explanation: |
      Irrelevant search results are as bad as no search because
      users lose trust and stop searching.
    remediation: Improve search relevance through tuning and metadata
  - id: SEARCH-HIGH-002
    signal: High rate of failed searches
    evidence_indicators:
    - Many searches return zero results
    - Users search for content that exists
    - Search analytics show frustration patterns
    explanation: |
      Failed searches indicate content discoverability problems
      or search configuration issues.
    remediation: Analyze failed searches and improve content/search
  - id: SEARCH-HIGH-003
    signal: Content lacks searchable metadata
    evidence_indicators:
    - No tags or keywords
    - Poor page titles
    - Missing descriptions
    explanation: |
      Without metadata, search can only use full-text, which
      often produces poor results.
    remediation: Add tags and metadata to content
  medium:
  - id: SEARCH-MED-001
    signal: Synonyms and variations not handled
    explanation: |
      Users search using different terms. Without synonym handling,
      they may miss relevant content.
    remediation: Implement synonym mapping
  - id: SEARCH-MED-002
    signal: No search suggestions or autocomplete
    remediation: Add search suggestions to guide users
  - id: SEARCH-MED-003
    signal: Search doesn't filter by content type
    remediation: Add faceted search capabilities
  low:
  - id: SEARCH-LOW-001
    signal: Search analytics not monitored
    remediation: Implement search analytics monitoring
  - id: SEARCH-LOW-002
    signal: Search results display not optimized
    remediation: Improve search result presentation
  positive:
  - id: SEARCH-POS-001
    signal: Search returns relevant results
  - id: SEARCH-POS-002
    signal: Content well-tagged for search
  - id: SEARCH-POS-003
