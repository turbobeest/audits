  what: |
    This audit evaluates the organization and structure of internal wikis
    and documentation platforms. The audit examines information architecture,
    navigation, categorization, and overall usability for finding and
    contributing information.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poorly organized wikis become documentation graveyards where information
    goes to die. When content is hard to find, people don't use the wiki,
    leading to knowledge silos and repeated questions. Good organization
    enables self-service information discovery and knowledge sharing.
  when_to_run:
  - When adopting new documentation platforms
  - When wiki usage is declining
  - During information architecture reviews
  - When onboarding shows documentation friction

signals:
  critical:
  - id: WIKI-CRIT-001
    signal: No central documentation platform exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - Documentation scattered across tools
    - No single source of truth
    - Teams maintain separate wikis
    explanation: |
      Without a central platform, documentation becomes fragmented
      and unfindable, leading to knowledge silos.
    remediation: Establish central documentation platform
  high:
  - id: WIKI-HIGH-001
    signal: Wiki navigation is confusing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deep nested hierarchies
    - Inconsistent categorization
    - Navigation doesn't match user mental models
    explanation: |
      Confusing navigation prevents people from finding information,
      reducing wiki value.
    remediation: Redesign navigation based on user needs
  - id: WIKI-HIGH-002
    signal: Content not categorized consistently
    evidence_indicators:
    - Similar content in different places
    - No clear category structure
    - Duplicate pages
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent categorization makes content hard to find and
      maintain.
    remediation: Establish and enforce content taxonomy
  - id: WIKI-HIGH-003
    signal: No content governance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Anyone can create pages anywhere
    - No content review process
    - Outdated content not cleaned up
    explanation: |
      Without governance, wikis become cluttered with outdated
      and duplicate content.
    remediation: Implement content governance process
  medium:
  - id: WIKI-MED-001
    signal: Search results are poor quality
    explanation: |
      If search doesn't return relevant results, users can't find
      information efficiently.
    remediation: Improve search configuration and content tagging
  - id: WIKI-MED-002
    signal: No landing page or index
    remediation: Create clear entry point with navigation guide
  - id: WIKI-MED-003
    signal: Templates not used consistently
    remediation: Create and promote content templates
  low:
  - id: WIKI-LOW-001
    signal: Page naming inconsistent
    remediation: Establish page naming conventions
  - id: WIKI-LOW-002
    signal: Links between pages sparse
    remediation: Improve cross-linking between related pages
  positive:
  - id: WIKI-POS-001
    signal: Clear, intuitive navigation
  - id: WIKI-POS-002
    signal: Consistent content categorization
  - id: WIKI-POS-003
    signal: Active content governance
