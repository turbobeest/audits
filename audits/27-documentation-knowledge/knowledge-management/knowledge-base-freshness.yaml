description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates how current and accurate knowledge base content is.
    The audit examines content age, review dates, update frequency, and
    processes for keeping documentation fresh. Stale documentation is
    identified and prioritized for update or removal.
  why_it_matters: |
    Outdated documentation is often worse than no documentation because it
    misleads users and erodes trust in the knowledge base. Fresh, accurate
    content encourages usage and maintains documentation value. Regular
    freshness reviews are essential for knowledge base health.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly knowledge base health reviews
  - When documentation trust is low
  - After major system changes
  - During documentation quality initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FRESH-CRIT-001
    signal: Majority of documentation severely outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - '>50% of content not updated in 2+ years'
    - References to deprecated systems
    - Users report inaccurate information
    explanation: |
      When most documentation is outdated, the knowledge base becomes
      untrustworthy and unused.
    remediation: Implement documentation review program urgently
  high:
  - id: FRESH-HIGH-001
    signal: Critical documentation outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Onboarding docs don't match current process
    - Runbooks reference old systems
    - API docs don't match implementation
    explanation: |
      Outdated critical documentation causes real problems for users.
    remediation: Prioritize update of critical documentation
  - id: FRESH-HIGH-002
    signal: No content review process
    evidence_indicators:
    - No review dates on content
    - No content ownership
    - No freshness tracking
    explanation: |
      Without a review process, documentation drifts out of date
      without anyone noticing.
    remediation: Implement periodic content review process
  medium:
  - id: FRESH-MED-001
    signal: Stale content not archived
    explanation: |
      Old content that remains visible clutters the knowledge base
      and may confuse users.
    remediation: Archive or clearly mark outdated content
  - id: FRESH-MED-002
    signal: Review dates not visible
    remediation: Add last review date to all content
  - id: FRESH-MED-003
    signal: No freshness metrics tracked
    remediation: Implement freshness monitoring
  low:
  - id: FRESH-LOW-001
    signal: Version references not updated
    remediation: Update version numbers in documentation
  - id: FRESH-LOW-002
    signal: Screenshots outdated
    remediation: Update visual content when UI changes
  positive:
  - id: FRESH-POS-001
    signal: Regular content review schedule
  - id: FRESH-POS-002
    signal: Content freshness metrics tracked
