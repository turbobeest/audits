description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates organizational practices for sharing knowledge
    between team members and teams. This includes documentation culture,
    knowledge sharing sessions, cross-team communication, and informal
    knowledge exchange mechanisms.
  why_it_matters: |
    Knowledge silos are a major organizational risk. When knowledge stays
    trapped in individuals or teams, the organization becomes fragile and
    loses the benefit of collective learning. Strong knowledge sharing
    practices accelerate problem-solving, reduce duplication, and improve
    organizational resilience.
  when_to_run:
  - During organizational culture reviews
  - When knowledge silos are identified
  - After team restructuring
  - During engineering effectiveness initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SHARE-CRIT-001
    signal: No knowledge sharing practices exist
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documentation culture
    - No technical talks or presentations
    - Teams don't communicate learnings
    explanation: |
      Without knowledge sharing, each team operates in isolation,
      repeating mistakes and missing opportunities.
    remediation: Establish knowledge sharing program
  high:
  - id: SHARE-HIGH-001
    signal: Knowledge sharing is one-directional
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only leadership shares knowledge
    - Teams consume but don't contribute
    - Documentation creation is someone else's job
    explanation: |
      When knowledge sharing is one-way, valuable insights from
      practitioners are lost.
    remediation: Encourage and incentivize broad participation
  - id: SHARE-HIGH-002
    signal: Cross-team knowledge sharing is rare
    evidence_indicators:
    - Teams don't know what others are doing
    - Duplicate solutions in different teams
    - No cross-team communication channels
    explanation: |
      Without cross-team sharing, organizations miss synergies
      and duplicate effort.
    remediation: Establish cross-team sharing mechanisms
  medium:
  - id: SHARE-MED-001
    signal: Knowledge sharing not recognized
    explanation: |
      When sharing isn't valued, people prioritize other work over
      documentation and teaching.
    remediation: Recognize and reward knowledge sharing
  - id: SHARE-MED-002
    signal: No time allocated for learning
    remediation: Allocate dedicated learning time
  - id: SHARE-MED-003
    signal: Learnings from incidents not shared
    remediation: Implement post-incident learning sharing
  low:
  - id: SHARE-LOW-001
    signal: Knowledge sharing events irregular
    remediation: Establish regular knowledge sharing cadence
  - id: SHARE-LOW-002
    signal: Shared knowledge not archived
    remediation: Archive presentations and learnings
  positive:
  - id: SHARE-POS-001
    signal: Active knowledge sharing culture
  - id: SHARE-POS-002
    signal: Cross-team guilds or communities
  - id: SHARE-POS-003
    signal: Knowledge sharing recognized and rewarded
