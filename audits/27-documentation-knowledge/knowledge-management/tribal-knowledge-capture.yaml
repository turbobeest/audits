description:
  what: |
    This audit identifies critical knowledge that exists only in individuals'
    heads and evaluates processes for capturing and documenting this tribal
    knowledge. The audit examines knowledge concentration risks, documentation
    gaps, and knowledge transfer practices.
  why_it_matters: |
    Tribal knowledge represents significant organizational risk. When key
    people leave, take vacation, or are unavailable, undocumented knowledge
    becomes inaccessible. Systematic capture of tribal knowledge reduces
    bus factor risk and enables organizational scalability.
  when_to_run:
  - Before key personnel transitions
  - When identifying single points of knowledge
  - During risk assessments
  - When scaling teams

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TRIBAL-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical systems understood by single person
    evidence_indicators:
    - One person handles all issues for a system
    - No backup for critical knowledge
    - System would be unmanageable if person leaves
    explanation: |
      Single points of knowledge for critical systems represent
      severe organizational risk.
    remediation: Urgently document and cross-train critical systems
  - id: TRIBAL-CRIT-002
    signal: Key person departure imminent without transfer
    evidence_indicators:
    - Planned departure with undocumented knowledge
    - No knowledge transfer plan
    - Tribal knowledge will be lost
    explanation: |
      Imminent knowledge loss requires immediate action to preserve
      critical information.
    remediation: Immediate knowledge capture before departure
  high:
  - id: TRIBAL-HIGH-001
    signal: Multiple systems with single-person knowledge
    evidence_indicators:
    - Pattern of go-to experts
    - Escalations always to same person
    - Bus factor < 2 for many areas
    explanation: |
      Widespread knowledge concentration creates organizational
      fragility.
    remediation: Systematic knowledge capture and cross-training
  - id: TRIBAL-HIGH-002
    signal: Historical context only in people's heads
    evidence_indicators:
    - Why decisions were made undocumented
    - System history verbal only
    - Context lost when people leave
    explanation: |
      Historical context is valuable for understanding systems and
      making informed decisions.
    remediation: Document historical context and decision rationale
  medium:
  - id: TRIBAL-MED-001
    signal: Onboarding requires extensive verbal transfer
    explanation: |
      Heavy reliance on verbal knowledge transfer indicates
      documentation gaps.
    remediation: Document onboarding knowledge gaps
  - id: TRIBAL-MED-002
    signal: Undocumented troubleshooting knowledge
    remediation: Capture troubleshooting expertise in runbooks
  - id: TRIBAL-MED-003
    signal: Process knowledge not documented
    remediation: Document team processes and workflows
  low:
  - id: TRIBAL-LOW-001
    signal: Tips and tricks not shared
    remediation: Create tips/tricks documentation
  - id: TRIBAL-LOW-002
    signal: No knowledge capture during transitions
    remediation: Implement exit knowledge transfer process
  positive:
  - id: TRIBAL-POS-001
    signal: Systematic knowledge capture program
  - id: TRIBAL-POS-002
    signal: Low bus factor across all systems
  - id: TRIBAL-POS-003
    signal: Regular knowledge documentation sprints
