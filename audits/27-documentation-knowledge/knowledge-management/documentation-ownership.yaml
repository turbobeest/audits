description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates how documentation ownership is assigned, tracked,
    and enforced. The audit examines whether documentation has clear owners,
    whether ownership is effective, and whether ownership transitions are
    handled properly.
  why_it_matters: |
    Documentation without clear ownership becomes orphaned and stale.
    When everyone is responsible, no one is responsible. Clear ownership
    ensures documentation is maintained, updated, and someone is accountable
    for its quality and accuracy.
  when_to_run:
  - During documentation quality reviews
  - After team reorganizations
  - When documentation staleness is identified
  - During knowledge management maturity assessments

  analysis_commands:
  - purpose: Find ownership metadata

  - purpose: Check for CODEOWNERS

signals:
  critical:
  - id: OWNER-CRIT-001
    signal: No documentation ownership model
    evidence_indicators:
    - No owners assigned to any docs
    - No ownership process
    - Documentation orphaned
    explanation: |
      Without ownership, documentation maintenance is nobody's
      responsibility, leading to decay.
    remediation: Establish documentation ownership model
  high:
  - id: OWNER-HIGH-001
    signal: Critical documentation has no owner
    evidence_indicators:
    - Key docs without assigned owner
    - Runbooks without ownership
    - API docs orphaned
    explanation: |
      Critical documentation without owners will become outdated,
      creating operational and integration risks.
    remediation: Assign owners to all critical documentation
  - id: OWNER-HIGH-002
    signal: Ownership not visible in documentation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Owners not listed on pages
    - Must search to find owners
    - Ownership only in external system
    explanation: |
      If ownership isn't visible, people don't know who to contact
      and owners may not feel accountable.
    remediation: Display ownership clearly on documentation
  - id: OWNER-HIGH-003
    signal: Owners not active maintainers
    evidence_indicators:
    - Owners haven't updated in >1 year
    - Owners no longer on team
    - Ownership is nominal only
    explanation: |
      Inactive ownership is effectively no ownership.
    remediation: Verify and update ownership assignments
  medium:
  - id: OWNER-MED-001
    signal: No ownership transition process
    explanation: |
      When owners change roles or leave, ownership must be
      transferred to maintain accountability.
    remediation: Implement ownership transition process
  - id: OWNER-MED-002
    signal: Ownership granularity inappropriate
    remediation: Adjust ownership scope for maintainability
  - id: OWNER-MED-003
    signal: Team ownership not clear
    remediation: Define team vs individual ownership model
  low:
  - id: OWNER-LOW-001
    signal: Ownership not enforced
    remediation: Implement ownership enforcement
  - id: OWNER-LOW-002
    signal: No ownership dashboard
    remediation: Create visibility into ownership status
  positive:
  - id: OWNER-POS-001
    signal: Clear ownership for all documentation
  - id: OWNER-POS-002
    signal: Active owners maintaining content
  - id: OWNER-POS-003
    signal: Ownership transitions handled smoothly
