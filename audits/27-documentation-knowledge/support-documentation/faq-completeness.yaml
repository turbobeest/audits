  what: |
    This audit evaluates the completeness and quality of FAQ (Frequently
    Asked Questions) documentation. The audit examines whether FAQs
    address actual frequent questions, are well-organized, and provide
    helpful answers.
  why_it_matters: |
    FAQs are often the first place users look for answers. Well-curated
    FAQs deflect support tickets, enable self-service, and demonstrate
    customer understanding. Poor FAQs waste user time and increase
    support burden.
  when_to_run:
  - During support optimization initiatives
  - When FAQ traffic is low despite support volume
  - After major product changes
  - During documentation reviews
