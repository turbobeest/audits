  what: |
    This audit evaluates internal support playbooks that guide support
    agents in handling customer issues. The audit examines playbook coverage
    for common scenarios, troubleshooting steps, escalation criteria, and
    resolution procedures.
  why_it_matters: |
    Support playbooks enable consistent, high-quality customer support.
    Without playbooks, support quality varies by agent, resolution times
    are longer, and incorrect solutions may be provided. Good playbooks
    scale support capability and ensure consistent customer experience.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing support processes
  - When support quality is inconsistent
  - After product changes affecting support
  - During support team training
