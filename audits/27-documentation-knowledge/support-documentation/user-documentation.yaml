  what: |
    This audit evaluates end-user documentation that helps customers or
    users understand and use the product. The audit examines user guides,
    feature documentation, tutorials, and help content for completeness,
    accuracy, and usability.
  why_it_matters: |
    User documentation directly impacts product adoption and customer
    success. Poor user documentation leads to support burden, user
    frustration, and churn. Good documentation enables self-service
    success and reduces support costs.
  when_to_run:
  - Before product launches
  - After major feature releases
  - When support tickets indicate documentation gaps
  - During customer experience reviews
