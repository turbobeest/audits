description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates the overall quality of the help center or support
    documentation portal. The audit examines content organization, search
    effectiveness, navigation, content freshness, and user experience across
    the entire help center.
  why_it_matters: |
    A well-designed help center enables customer self-service, reduces
    support costs, and improves customer satisfaction. Poor help center
    experiences frustrate users and drive unnecessary support contacts.
    Help center quality directly impacts support efficiency.
  when_to_run:
  - During help center redesigns
  - When self-service rates are low
  - After major content additions
  - Quarterly for continuous improvement
