  what: |
    This audit evaluates documentation of known issues, limitations, and
    workarounds. The audit examines how known problems are documented,
    communicated to users and support teams, and tracked for resolution.
  why_it_matters: |
    Known issues documentation reduces support burden by preemptively
    informing users of problems and workarounds. Without this documentation,
    support handles the same known issues repeatedly, users are frustrated
    by undocumented limitations, and engineering lacks visibility into
    user-impacting issues.
  when_to_run:
  - When support volume is high for known issues
  - Before major releases
  - During documentation reviews
  - When user frustration is reported

    command: find . -name '*known*' -o -name '*limitation*' | grep -E '\.(md|txt)$'

signals:
  critical:
  - id: KNOWN-CRIT-001
    signal: No known issues documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - Known issues not documented
    - Users unaware of limitations
    - Support handles same issues repeatedly
    explanation: |
      Without known issues documentation, users encounter problems
      without warning and support burden increases.
    remediation: Create known issues documentation
  high:
  - id: KNOWN-HIGH-001
    signal: Critical known issues not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Major bugs not in known issues
    - Users discover issues without warning
    - High support volume for known problems
    explanation: |
      Critical issues users will likely encounter should be documented
      with workarounds.
    remediation: Document all critical known issues
  - id: KNOWN-HIGH-002
    signal: Workarounds not provided
    evidence_indicators:
    - Issues documented without solutions
    - Users stuck without alternatives
    - No temporary fixes provided
    explanation: |
      Known issues without workarounds leave users with no recourse.
    remediation: Add workarounds for all known issues
  - id: KNOWN-HIGH-003
    signal: Known issues not communicated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Documentation exists but users unaware
    - Known issues not in release notes
    - Support doesn't reference known issues
    explanation: |
      Documentation is useless if users can't find it.
    remediation: Improve known issues visibility and communication
  medium:
  - id: KNOWN-MED-001
    signal: Known issues not categorized
    explanation: |
      Categorization helps users find relevant known issues.
    remediation: Organize known issues by feature/severity
  - id: KNOWN-MED-002
    signal: Resolution timeline not provided
    remediation: Add expected fix timeline where possible
  - id: KNOWN-MED-003
    signal: Known issues not linked to tracking
    remediation: Link known issues to issue tracker
  low:
  - id: KNOWN-LOW-001
    signal: Historical known issues not archived
    remediation: Archive resolved known issues
  - id: KNOWN-LOW-002
    signal: No known issues update process
    remediation: Establish regular known issues review
  positive:
  - id: KNOWN-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive known issues documentation
  - id: KNOWN-POS-002
    signal: Workarounds provided for all issues
  - id: KNOWN-POS-003
    signal: Known issues prominently communicated
