  what: |
    This audit evaluates documentation of escalation procedures for support,
    incidents, and other situations requiring involvement of additional
    stakeholders. The audit examines escalation paths, criteria, contacts,
    and procedures.
  why_it_matters: |
    Clear escalation documentation ensures issues reach the right people at
    the right time. Without documented escalation procedures, critical issues
    may be delayed, wrong people may be contacted, or issues may fall through
    the cracks. Proper escalation documentation is essential for incident
    response and support operations.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing support or incident processes
  - After escalation failures
  - During incident response reviews
  - When teams or responsibilities change

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ESC-CRIT-001
    signal: No escalation documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No escalation paths documented
    - Staff don't know who to contact
    - Escalations handled ad-hoc
    explanation: |
      Without escalation documentation, critical issues may not reach
      the right people, leading to delayed resolution.
    remediation: Create comprehensive escalation documentation
  - id: ESC-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical system escalation undocumented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Production systems have no escalation path
    - P0/P1 incidents lack escalation guidance
    - Database, security, or infrastructure escalation missing
    explanation: |
      Critical systems require documented escalation for incidents.
    remediation: Document escalation for all critical systems
  high:
  - id: ESC-HIGH-001
    signal: Escalation contacts outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Contacts have left company
    - Phone numbers/emails incorrect
    - On-call schedules not current
    explanation: |
      Outdated contacts cause delays when escalation is needed.
    remediation: Establish process to keep contacts current
  - id: ESC-HIGH-002
    signal: Escalation criteria unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - When to escalate not documented
    - Severity definitions missing
    - Staff unsure when to escalate
    explanation: |
      Unclear criteria lead to over-escalation or under-escalation.
    remediation: Document clear escalation criteria
  - id: ESC-HIGH-003
    signal: Escalation paths incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - Primary contact but no backup
    - No management escalation
    - Gaps in coverage
    explanation: |
      Incomplete paths mean escalation may fail when primary is
      unavailable.
    remediation: Document complete escalation chains
  medium:
  - id: ESC-MED-001
    signal: Escalation procedures not role-specific
    explanation: |
      Different roles may need different escalation guidance.
    remediation: Create role-specific escalation guides
  - id: ESC-MED-002
    signal: Cross-team escalation unclear
    remediation: Document inter-team escalation procedures
  - id: ESC-MED-003
    signal: Vendor escalation not documented
    remediation: Document vendor/third-party escalation
  low:
  - id: ESC-LOW-001
    signal: Escalation documentation hard to find
    remediation: Improve escalation doc discoverability
  - id: ESC-LOW-002
    signal: No escalation training
    remediation: Include escalation in onboarding/training
  positive:
  - id: ESC-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive escalation documentation
  - id: ESC-POS-002
    signal: Escalation contacts regularly verified
  - id: ESC-POS-003
    signal: Clear escalation criteria documented
