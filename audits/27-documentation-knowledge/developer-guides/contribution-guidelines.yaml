  what: |
    This audit evaluates contribution guidelines that help developers
    contribute code, documentation, or other improvements to a project.
    The audit examines clarity of the contribution process, coding standards,
    review expectations, and community guidelines.
  why_it_matters: |
    Clear contribution guidelines reduce friction for contributors and
    maintainers alike. Without them, contributions may be inconsistent,
    review cycles extend, and potential contributors may not understand
    how to participate. Good guidelines enable efficient collaboration
    and code quality.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing open source projects
  - When contribution quality is inconsistent
  - During community health reviews
  - When onboarding new team members

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CONTRIB-CRIT-001
    signal: No contribution guidelines exist
    evidence_indicators:
    - No CONTRIBUTING file
    - Contributors unsure how to participate
    - Inconsistent contribution quality
    explanation: |
      Without contribution guidelines, potential contributors don't
      know how to participate and may not contribute at all.
    remediation: Create comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md
  high:
  - id: CONTRIB-HIGH-001
    signal: Contribution process unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - Steps to contribute not documented
    - Contributors ask basic process questions
    - PRs frequently violate undocumented rules
    explanation: |
      Unclear processes lead to frustrated contributors and wasted
      review cycles for non-compliant contributions.
    remediation: Document step-by-step contribution process
  - id: CONTRIB-HIGH-002
    signal: Coding standards not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Style inconsistency in codebase
    - Reviews frequently cite style issues
    - No style guide reference
    explanation: |
      Without coding standards, contributions have inconsistent style,
      increasing review burden and reducing code quality.
    remediation: Document coding standards or link to style guide
  - id: CONTRIB-HIGH-003
    signal: Review expectations not set
    evidence_indicators:
    - Contributors don't know what to expect
    - Review timelines undefined
    - Review criteria unclear
    explanation: |
      Unclear review expectations lead to contributor frustration and
      abandoned contributions.
    remediation: Document review process and expectations
  medium:
  - id: CONTRIB-MED-001
    signal: Development setup not documented
    explanation: |
      Contributors need to set up development environments before
      contributing. Missing setup docs block contributions.
    remediation: Add development environment setup instructions
  - id: CONTRIB-MED-002
    signal: Testing requirements not specified
    remediation: Document testing requirements for contributions
  - id: CONTRIB-MED-003
    signal: No code of conduct
    remediation: Add code of conduct for community standards
  - id: CONTRIB-MED-004
    signal: Issue and PR templates missing
    remediation: Add templates to guide submissions
  low:
  - id: CONTRIB-LOW-001
    signal: No recognition for contributors
    remediation: Add contributors recognition process
  - id: CONTRIB-LOW-002
    signal: Communication channels not documented
    remediation: Document where contributors can get help
  positive:
  - id: CONTRIB-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive contribution guidelines
  - id: CONTRIB-POS-002
