  what: |
    This audit evaluates getting started guides and quickstart documentation
    that help new developers begin working with a project, API, or platform.
    The audit examines the onboarding experience from first contact to first
    success, including prerequisites, setup steps, and first working example.
  why_it_matters: |
    The getting started experience determines whether developers adopt or
    abandon a project. Poor getting started documentation leads to high
    abandonment, support burden, and missed adoption opportunities. A great
    quickstart enables developers to achieve success quickly, building
    confidence and momentum.
  when_to_run:
  - When launching new projects or APIs
  - When adoption metrics show friction
  - During developer experience reviews
  - After major project changes

  analysis_commands:
  - purpose: Find getting started documentation
    command: find . -name 'README.md' -o -name '*quickstart*' -o -name '*getting-started*' | head -10
  - purpose: Check for prerequisites section
    command: grep -l -i 'prerequisite\|requirement\|before you begin' README.md docs/*.md
  - purpose: Find installation instructions
    command: grep -A10 -i '## install' README.md
signals:
  critical:
  - id: GETSTART-CRIT-001
    signal: No getting started documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No README or quickstart
    - Developers cannot start without support
    - No setup instructions anywhere
    explanation: |
      Without getting started documentation, developers cannot begin
      using the project without significant support investment.
    remediation: Create comprehensive getting started guide
  - id: GETSTART-CRIT-002
    signal: Getting started steps don't work
    evidence_indicators:
    - Commands fail when executed
    - Missing files or dependencies
    - Steps skip critical requirements
    explanation: |
      Broken getting started guides are extremely frustrating and
      lead to immediate abandonment.
    remediation: Test and fix all getting started steps
  high:
  - id: GETSTART-HIGH-001
    signal: Prerequisites not clearly listed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Setup fails due to missing dependencies
    - Required tools not mentioned
    - Environment requirements unclear
    explanation: |
      Unclear prerequisites cause setup failures and wasted time
      troubleshooting missing dependencies.
    remediation: List all prerequisites with versions
  - id: GETSTART-HIGH-002
    signal: No working example to verify success
    evidence_indicators:
    - No 'hello world' or verification step
    - Developers unsure if setup worked
    - No output to confirm success
    explanation: |
      Without a verification step, developers don't know if they've
      succeeded and may proceed with broken setups.
    remediation: Add verification step with expected output
  - id: GETSTART-HIGH-003
    signal: Time to first success exceeds 30 minutes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Many steps before first working example
    - Complex configuration required
    - Lengthy compilation or setup
    explanation: |
      Long time-to-success causes abandonment. Developers need quick
      wins to build confidence.
    remediation: Optimize for fastest path to first success
  medium:
  - id: GETSTART-MED-001
    signal: Single platform only documented
    explanation: |
      Developers use different operating systems. Single-platform
      docs exclude significant portions of users.
    remediation: Add instructions for major platforms
  - id: GETSTART-MED-002
    signal: Troubleshooting section missing
    remediation: Add common setup issues and solutions
  - id: GETSTART-MED-003
    signal: No next steps after getting started
    remediation: Link to further learning resources
  low:
  - id: GETSTART-LOW-001
    signal: Screenshots or visuals missing
    remediation: Add visual aids for complex steps
  - id: GETSTART-LOW-002
    signal: Copy-paste commands not formatted
    remediation: Use code blocks for all commands
  positive:
  - id: GETSTART-POS-001
    signal: Working in under 5 minutes
  - id: GETSTART-POS-002
    signal: Multi-platform instructions provided
  - id: GETSTART-POS-003
    signal: Troubleshooting for common issues included
