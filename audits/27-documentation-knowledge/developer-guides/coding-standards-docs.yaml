description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates documentation of coding standards, style guides,
    and best practices for the project. The audit examines coverage of
    language-specific standards, project conventions, architectural patterns,
    and enforcement mechanisms.
  why_it_matters: |
    Documented coding standards ensure consistency across the codebase,
    reduce cognitive load when reading code, and minimize style-related
    review feedback. Without standards, code becomes inconsistent, reviews
    become contentious, and new developers struggle to match existing
    patterns.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing new projects
  - During code quality initiatives
  - When onboarding new team members
  - When code reviews frequently cite style issues

signals:
  critical:
  - id: STANDARDS-CRIT-001
    signal: No coding standards documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No style guide or standards document
    - No linting configuration
    - Code style varies widely
    explanation: |
      Without documented standards, code style becomes inconsistent
      and code reviews become contentious.
    remediation: Adopt and document coding standards
  high:
  - id: STANDARDS-HIGH-001
    signal: Standards documented but not enforced
    evidence_indicators:
    - No linting in CI/CD
    - Violations committed regularly
    - Standards document ignored
    explanation: |
      Unenforced standards are effectively no standards. Documentation
      without enforcement becomes outdated and irrelevant.
    remediation: Implement automated enforcement via linting
  - id: STANDARDS-HIGH-002
    signal: Language-specific standards missing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multi-language project without per-language standards
    - Some languages have standards, others don't
    explanation: |
      Each language has its own idioms and conventions. Missing
      language-specific guidance leads to inconsistency.
    remediation: Document standards for each language in use
  - id: STANDARDS-HIGH-003
    signal: Architectural patterns undocumented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Similar problems solved differently
    - No pattern documentation
    - New code doesn't follow existing patterns
    explanation: |
      Beyond style, projects need documented patterns for how to
      solve common problems consistently.
    remediation: Document architectural patterns and examples
  medium:
  - id: STANDARDS-MED-001
    signal: Standards not aligned with tooling
    explanation: |
      When standards differ from linting configuration, developers
      receive conflicting guidance.
    remediation: Align documentation with linting configuration
  - id: STANDARDS-MED-002
    signal: No examples in standards documentation
    remediation: Add good and bad examples for each standard
  - id: STANDARDS-MED-003
    signal: Naming conventions not documented
    remediation: Document naming conventions for all entity types
  low:
  - id: STANDARDS-LOW-001
    signal: Standards document not versioned with code
    remediation: Keep standards documentation in repository
  - id: STANDARDS-LOW-002
    signal: No rationale for standards choices
    remediation: Add rationale explaining why standards exist
  positive:
  - id: STANDARDS-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive standards with automated enforcement
  - id: STANDARDS-POS-002
    signal: Standards include examples and rationale
  - id: STANDARDS-POS-003
    signal: Standards updated and actively maintained
