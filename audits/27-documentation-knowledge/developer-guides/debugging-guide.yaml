  what: |
    This audit evaluates debugging documentation that helps developers
    diagnose and fix issues in the codebase. This includes debugger setup,
    logging guidance, common debugging scenarios, and tools for investigation.
    The audit examines whether debugging documentation enables efficient
    problem resolution.
  why_it_matters: |
    Debugging is a significant part of development time. Good debugging
    documentation reduces time spent on diagnosis, enables less experienced
    developers to solve problems independently, and captures institutional
    knowledge about common issues. Without it, debugging becomes trial-and-
    error and experts become bottlenecks.
  when_to_run:
  - When onboarding new developers
  - After resolving complex bugs (to document learnings)
  - During developer productivity reviews
  - When debugging tickets are frequently escalated

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEBUG-CRIT-001
    signal: No debugging documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No debugging guides found
    - Developers rely entirely on experts
    - No debugger configurations shared
    explanation: |
      Without debugging documentation, each developer must discover
      debugging techniques independently, wasting time and creating
      expert bottlenecks.
    remediation: Create debugging guide with common scenarios
  high:
  - id: DEBUG-HIGH-001
    signal: Debugger setup not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No launch.json or debug configuration
    - Developers don't know how to attach debugger
    - Debugging done via print statements only
    explanation: |
      Without debugger setup, developers use less efficient debugging
      methods and miss powerful debugging capabilities.
    remediation: Document debugger setup with IDE configurations
  - id: DEBUG-HIGH-002
    signal: Logging levels and usage not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Inconsistent log level usage
    - Developers unsure what to log
    - No guidance on enabling debug logs
    explanation: |
      Logs are primary debugging tools. Without guidance, logging
      is inconsistent and less useful for debugging.
    remediation: Document logging conventions and level usage
  medium:
  - id: DEBUG-MED-001
    signal: Common debugging scenarios not documented
    explanation: |
      Documenting common scenarios saves time when similar issues
      occur and enables self-service debugging.
    remediation: Document common debugging scenarios and solutions
  - id: DEBUG-MED-002
    signal: No remote debugging guidance
    remediation: Document remote debugging setup for non-local environments
  - id: DEBUG-MED-003
    signal: Profiling tools not documented
    remediation: Document profiling tools and usage
  low:
  - id: DEBUG-LOW-001
    signal: Debug output interpretation not documented
    remediation: Explain how to interpret stack traces and logs
  - id: DEBUG-LOW-002
    signal: No debugging workflow documented
    remediation: Document systematic debugging approach
  positive:
  - id: DEBUG-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive debugging guide with scenarios
  - id: DEBUG-POS-002
    signal: Debugger configurations checked into repo
  - id: DEBUG-POS-003
    signal: Common issues documented with solutions
