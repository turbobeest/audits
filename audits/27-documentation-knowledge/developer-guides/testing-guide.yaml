description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates testing documentation that guides developers on
    writing and running tests. This includes testing standards, framework
    usage, test organization, mocking strategies, CI integration, and
    coverage requirements.
  why_it_matters: |
    Testing is critical for code quality and confidence. Without testing
    documentation, developers may not write tests, write ineffective tests,
    or not know how to run existing tests. Good testing guides ensure
    consistent, valuable test coverage across the team.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing testing practices
  - During quality improvement initiatives
  - When onboarding new developers
  - When test quality or coverage is inconsistent

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TEST-CRIT-001
    signal: No testing documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No testing guide found
    - Developers don't know how to run tests
    - Test structure undefined
    explanation: |
      Without testing documentation, developers may not write tests
      or may write tests that don't follow team conventions.
    remediation: Create comprehensive testing guide
  high:
  - id: TEST-HIGH-001
    signal: How to run tests not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No test run commands documented
    - Developers guess at test commands
    - Tests not run consistently
    explanation: |
      If developers don't know how to run tests, they won't run
      them before committing, reducing test value.
    remediation: Document all test run commands prominently
  - id: TEST-HIGH-002
    signal: Test organization not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Tests scattered inconsistently
    - Unclear where to put new tests
    - Test file naming varies
    explanation: |
      Unclear test organization makes tests hard to find and
      leads to inconsistent patterns.
    remediation: Document test organization and naming conventions
  - id: TEST-HIGH-003
    signal: Testing standards not defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - Test quality varies widely
    - No coverage requirements
    - Mocking approaches inconsistent
    explanation: |
      Without standards, test quality varies and some tests
      provide little value.
    remediation: Define and document testing standards
  medium:
  - id: TEST-MED-001
    signal: Mocking and fixture usage not documented
    explanation: |
      Mocking is complex. Without guidance, developers may mock
      incorrectly or create brittle tests.
    remediation: Document mocking strategies and fixture usage
  - id: TEST-MED-002
    signal: No examples of good tests
    remediation: Provide example tests demonstrating best practices
  - id: TEST-MED-003
    signal: CI test integration not documented
    remediation: Document how tests run in CI and how to interpret results
  low:
  - id: TEST-LOW-001
    signal: Test troubleshooting not documented
    remediation: Document common test failures and solutions
  - id: TEST-LOW-002
    signal: Coverage requirements not specified
    remediation: Document coverage targets and how to measure
  positive:
  - id: TEST-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive testing guide with examples
  - id: TEST-POS-002
    signal: Testing standards enforced in CI
  - id: TEST-POS-003
    signal: Test patterns documented for common scenarios
