  what: |
    This audit evaluates documentation for setting up local development
    environments. This includes IDE setup, dependency installation,
    environment configuration, local service setup, and development
    workflow documentation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Development environment setup is a common source of friction and wasted
    time. Poor setup documentation leads to days lost troubleshooting,
    inconsistent environments causing "works on my machine" issues, and
    delayed onboarding. Good setup docs enable productive development
    within hours instead of days.
  when_to_run:
  - When onboarding new developers
  - After changing development tools or dependencies
  - When developers report setup difficulties
  - During developer experience reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEVSETUP-CRIT-001
    signal: No development setup documentation
    evidence_indicators:
    - No setup instructions found
    - Developers cannot set up without help
    - Each developer figures it out independently
    explanation: |
      Without setup documentation, each new developer wastes significant
      time recreating the setup process.
    remediation: Create comprehensive development setup guide
  - id: DEVSETUP-CRIT-002
    signal: Setup documentation is critically broken
    evidence_indicators:
    - Documented steps don't work
    - Missing critical steps
    - References non-existent files or services
    explanation: |
      Broken setup documentation is worse than none because developers
      follow it before discovering it doesn't work.
    remediation: Test and fix setup documentation immediately
  high:
  - id: DEVSETUP-HIGH-001
    signal: Environment variables not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No .env.example file
    - Required variables not listed
    - Developers guess at required config
    explanation: |
      Undocumented environment variables cause application failures
      that are difficult to diagnose.
    remediation: Create .env.example with all required variables documented
  - id: DEVSETUP-HIGH-002
    signal: Local service dependencies undocumented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Required databases not mentioned
    - Message queues or caches not documented
    - Setup fails due to missing services
    explanation: |
      Undocumented service dependencies cause setup failures and
      runtime errors.
    remediation: Document all local service requirements
  - id: DEVSETUP-HIGH-003
    signal: Multi-platform setup not addressed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only one OS documented
    - Platform-specific issues not addressed
    - Developers on other platforms struggle
    explanation: |
      Developers use different operating systems. Single-platform
      documentation excludes team members.
    remediation: Add setup instructions for major platforms
  medium:
  - id: DEVSETUP-MED-001
    signal: IDE setup not documented
    explanation: |
      IDE configuration for debugging, linting, and formatting saves
      significant setup time.
    remediation: Document IDE setup or provide configuration files
  - id: DEVSETUP-MED-002
    signal: No containerized development option
    remediation: Consider dev containers for consistent environments
  - id: DEVSETUP-MED-003
    signal: Setup troubleshooting not included
    remediation: Add common issues and solutions
  low:
  - id: DEVSETUP-LOW-001
    signal: No setup verification steps
    remediation: Add verification steps to confirm successful setup
  - id: DEVSETUP-LOW-002
    signal: Recommended hardware not specified
    remediation: Document minimum and recommended hardware
  positive:
  - id: DEVSETUP-POS-001
    signal: One-command development setup available
  - id: DEVSETUP-POS-002
    signal: Dev containers or codespaces configured
  - id: DEVSETUP-POS-003
    signal: Setup verified automatically in CI
