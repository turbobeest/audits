description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates documentation of system integrations including
    internal service-to-service communication and external third-party
    integrations. The audit examines API contracts, authentication methods,
    error handling, SLAs, and dependency documentation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Integration points are common sources of failures and confusion.
    Without documentation, teams struggle to debug integration issues,
    plan for third-party changes, or understand the impact of their
    changes on dependent systems.
  when_to_run:
  - When adding new integrations
  - After integration failures
  - During dependency risk assessments
  - When onboarding teams to integration maintenance

signals:
  critical:
  - id: INTEGRATION-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical integrations undocumented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Payment provider integration undocumented
    - Authentication provider not documented
    - Core business integrations unknown
    explanation: |
      Undocumented critical integrations create significant risk
      when issues occur or providers make changes.
    remediation: Document all critical integrations immediately
  high:
  - id: INTEGRATION-HIGH-001
    signal: Integration contracts not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - API contracts not recorded
    - Expected request/response unknown
    - Error codes not documented
    explanation: |
      Without documented contracts, debugging integration issues
      and planning changes is extremely difficult.
    remediation: Document API contracts for all integrations
  - id: INTEGRATION-HIGH-002
    signal: Authentication methods undocumented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Credential management unclear
    - Auth flow not documented
    - Token refresh process unknown
    explanation: |
      Undocumented authentication creates security risk and makes
      troubleshooting auth failures difficult.
    remediation: Document authentication for all integrations
  - id: INTEGRATION-HIGH-003
    signal: Integration SLAs not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Provider SLAs unknown
    - Availability expectations unclear
    - Rate limits not documented
    explanation: |
      Without SLA documentation, teams cannot design appropriate
      resilience or plan capacity.
    remediation: Document SLAs and rate limits for integrations
  medium:
  - id: INTEGRATION-MED-001
    signal: Error handling not documented
    explanation: |
      Without documented error handling, systems may not handle
      integration failures gracefully.
    remediation: Document error scenarios and handling
  - id: INTEGRATION-MED-002
    signal: Integration dependencies not mapped
    remediation: Create integration dependency map
  - id: INTEGRATION-MED-003
    signal: Fallback procedures not documented
    remediation: Document fallback when integrations fail
  low:
  - id: INTEGRATION-LOW-001
    signal: Contact information for providers missing
    remediation: Document vendor contacts and escalation
  - id: INTEGRATION-LOW-002
    signal: Integration testing approach not documented
    remediation: Document how to test integrations
  positive:
  - id: INTEGRATION-POS-001
    signal: All integrations comprehensively documented
  - id: INTEGRATION-POS-002
    signal: Integration contracts maintained in repository
  - id: INTEGRATION-POS-003
    signal: Regular integration documentation reviews
