description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates team-specific onboarding documentation that
    supplements general onboarding. The audit examines whether individual
    teams have documented their specific context, systems, processes, and
    expectations for new team members.
  why_it_matters: |
    General onboarding covers company-wide basics, but each team has
    unique systems, processes, and context. Team-specific onboarding
    accelerates integration into the specific team and its work.
    Without it, new hires struggle to understand team-specific nuances.
  when_to_run:
  - When new team members join
  - After team restructuring
  - During team documentation reviews
  - When onboarding feedback indicates team-level gaps
