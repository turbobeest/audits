  what: |
    This audit evaluates the completeness of onboarding documentation for
    new team members. The audit examines coverage of essential topics,
    clarity of instructions, and effectiveness in enabling new hires to
    become productive.
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective onboarding documentation accelerates time-to-productivity
    for new team members. Poor onboarding leads to extended ramp-up times,
    frustration, repeated questions, and early attrition. Comprehensive
    onboarding documentation is a force multiplier for growing teams.
