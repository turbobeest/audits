description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates documentation of learning paths and skill
    development resources for team members. The audit examines structured
    learning recommendations, skill development resources, and progression
    guidance for different roles and levels.
  why_it_matters: |
    Learning paths guide professional development and help team members
    grow systematically. Without documented paths, learning is ad-hoc,
    skill development is inconsistent, and career progression is unclear.
    Good learning paths enable self-directed development.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing development programs
  - During career framework reviews
  - When skill gaps are identified
  - When onboarding senior hires

signals:
  critical:
  - id: LEARN-CRIT-001
    signal: No learning resources documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No learning paths exist
    - Development resources unknown
    - Learning is entirely self-directed
    explanation: |
      Without learning resources, skill development is haphazard
      and team members may not grow effectively.
    remediation: Document learning resources and paths
  high:
  - id: LEARN-HIGH-001
    signal: Role-specific learning not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Generic learning only
    - No paths for specific roles
    - Career progression unclear
    explanation: |
      Different roles need different skills. Generic learning
      doesn't address specific role needs.
    remediation: Create role-specific learning paths
  - id: LEARN-HIGH-002
    signal: Skill expectations by level not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No career ladder
    - Level expectations unclear
    - Progression criteria unknown
    explanation: |
      Without documented expectations, team members don't know
      what skills to develop for advancement.
    remediation: Document skill expectations by level
  medium:
  - id: LEARN-MED-001
    signal: Learning resources not curated
    explanation: |
      Uncurated resources are overwhelming. Curation helps focus
      on quality resources.
    remediation: Curate recommended learning resources
  - id: LEARN-MED-002
    signal: No internal training documented
    remediation: Document internal training and resources
  - id: LEARN-MED-003
    signal: Tech stack learning not addressed
    remediation: Create tech stack learning resources
  low:
  - id: LEARN-LOW-001
    signal: Learning time allocation unclear
    remediation: Document learning time expectations
  - id: LEARN-LOW-002
    signal: No learning community
    remediation: Establish learning community or guild
  positive:
  - id: LEARN-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive learning paths by role
  - id: LEARN-POS-002
    signal: Curated learning resources
  - id: LEARN-POS-003
    signal: Active learning community
