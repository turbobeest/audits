  what: |
    This audit evaluates documentation of tool access requirements and
    procedures for new team members. The audit examines whether all
    required tools are documented, access procedures are clear, and
    new hires can get productive without extensive help.
  why_it_matters: |
    Tool access issues are a common onboarding blocker. Without clear
    documentation, new hires spend days requesting access, waiting for
    approvals, and troubleshooting access problems. Good access documentation
    enables self-service onboarding for tools.
  when_to_run:
  - When onboarding new team members
  - After tool stack changes
  - When access issues delay onboarding
  - During IT/security reviews
prerequisites:
  required_artifacts:
  - type: tool_inventory

  - type: access_procedures
    description: Access request procedures
  access_requirements:
  - Read access to onboarding documentation
  - Access to IT/security for validation

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ACCESS-CRIT-001
    signal: No tool access documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No list of required tools
    - Access procedures not documented
    - New hires figure out access themselves
    explanation: |
      Without access documentation, new hires waste significant time
      discovering what tools they need and how to get access.
    remediation: Create comprehensive tool access documentation
  high:
  - id: ACCESS-HIGH-001
    signal: Tool inventory incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - Required tools not listed
    - New hires discover tools later
    - Access gaps cause blockers
    explanation: |
      Incomplete tool lists mean new hires get blocked when they
      discover additional required tools.
    remediation: Complete tool inventory for all roles
  - id: ACCESS-HIGH-002
    signal: Access procedures not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - How to request access unclear
    - Approval process unknown
    - Self-service not possible
    explanation: |
      Undocumented access procedures create dependency on others
      for every access request.
    remediation: Document access request procedures for all tools
  - id: ACCESS-HIGH-003
    signal: Access documentation outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Procedures changed
    - Tools no longer in use
    - Links broken
    explanation: |
      Outdated access docs cause confusion and failed access attempts.
    remediation: Update access documentation regularly
  medium:
  - id: ACCESS-MED-001
    signal: Role-based access not documented
    explanation: |
      Different roles need different access. Without role mapping,
      new hires may request wrong access levels.
    remediation: Document access requirements by role
  - id: ACCESS-MED-002
    signal: Access timeline not set
    remediation: Document expected access provisioning timeline
  - id: ACCESS-MED-003
    signal: Troubleshooting not included
    remediation: Add common access issues and solutions
  low:
  - id: ACCESS-LOW-001
    signal: No access verification checklist
    remediation: Add checklist to verify all access
  - id: ACCESS-LOW-002
    signal: Tool purpose not explained
    remediation: Add brief description of why each tool is needed
  positive:
  - id: ACCESS-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive tool access documentation
  - id: ACCESS-POS-002
    signal: Self-service access procedures
  - id: ACCESS-POS-003
    signal: Role-based access clearly mapped
