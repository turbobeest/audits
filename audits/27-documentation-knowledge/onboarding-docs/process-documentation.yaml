  what: |
    This audit evaluates documentation of team and engineering processes
    that new hires need to understand. This includes development workflows,
    code review processes, deployment procedures, and team ceremonies.
  why_it_matters: |
    Process knowledge enables effective participation in team activities.
    Without documented processes, new hires don't know how work gets done,
    leading to mistakes, delays, and reliance on others for basic guidance.
    Clear process documentation enables autonomous contribution.
  when_to_run:
  - When onboarding new team members
  - After process changes
  - When process compliance is inconsistent
  - During team process reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PROCESS-CRIT-001
    signal: No process documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - Processes only verbal
    - New hires must ask about everything
    - Processes vary by person
    explanation: |
      Without process documentation, work is inconsistent and new
      hires cannot operate independently.
    remediation: Document core team processes
  high:
  - id: PROCESS-HIGH-001
    signal: Development workflow not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - How to make changes unclear
    - Branch strategy undocumented
    - PR process not explained
    explanation: |
      Development workflow is daily work. Undocumented workflow
      causes errors and inconsistency.
    remediation: Document development workflow end-to-end
  - id: PROCESS-HIGH-002
    signal: Code review process not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Review expectations unclear
    - Who reviews undocumented
    - Review standards not stated
    explanation: |
      Code review affects every change. Unclear process causes
      delays and inconsistent reviews.
    remediation: Document code review process and expectations
  - id: PROCESS-HIGH-003
    signal: Deployment process not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - How to deploy unclear
    - Deployment approval unknown
    - Rollback process not documented
    explanation: |
      Deployment is high-risk. Undocumented processes lead to errors.
    remediation: Document deployment process thoroughly
  medium:
  - id: PROCESS-MED-001
    signal: Team ceremonies not documented
    explanation: |
      Ceremonies like standups, retros, and planning need documentation
      for new members to participate effectively.
    remediation: Document team ceremonies and expectations
  - id: PROCESS-MED-002
    signal: Escalation process not documented
    remediation: Document how to escalate issues
  - id: PROCESS-MED-003
    signal: On-call process not documented
    remediation: Document on-call expectations and procedures
  low:
  - id: PROCESS-LOW-001
    signal: Process diagrams missing
    remediation: Add visual workflow diagrams
  - id: PROCESS-LOW-002
    signal: Process rationale not explained
    remediation: Explain why processes exist
  positive:
  - id: PROCESS-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive process documentation
  - id: PROCESS-POS-002
    signal: Process diagrams included
