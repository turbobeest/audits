description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates documentation supporting mentorship and buddy
    programs for new hires. The audit examines resources for both mentors
    and mentees, program guidelines, and supporting documentation for
    effective mentorship.
  why_it_matters: |
    Mentorship accelerates onboarding by providing personalized guidance
    and support. Documentation enables consistent mentorship quality,
    helps mentors be effective, and ensures mentees get the support they
    need. Without resources, mentorship quality varies widely.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing mentorship programs
  - When mentorship effectiveness is inconsistent
  - During onboarding program reviews
  - When scaling hiring
