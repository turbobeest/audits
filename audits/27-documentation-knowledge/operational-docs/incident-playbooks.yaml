  what: |
    This audit evaluates incident response playbooks that guide teams through
    handling specific types of incidents. Unlike general runbooks, incident
    playbooks are optimized for high-stress situations with clear decision
    trees, escalation paths, and communication templates. The audit examines
    coverage of common incident types, playbook clarity, and integration with
    incident management tooling.
  why_it_matters: |
    During incidents, responders experience cognitive load and stress that
    impairs decision-making. Well-designed incident playbooks reduce mean
    time to resolution (MTTR) by providing clear, tested procedures that
    don't require creative problem-solving in crisis moments. Organizations
    without playbooks see longer incidents, more customer impact, and
    higher responder burnout.
  when_to_run:
  - After major incidents to identify playbook gaps
  - During incident management program reviews
  - When onboarding new on-call responders
  - Quarterly as part of operational readiness

    questions:
    - When you're paged, where do you find incident playbooks?

    - What incident types lack adequate playbooks?
    - How do playbooks get updated after incidents?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PLAYBOOK-CRIT-001
    signal: No incident playbooks exist
    evidence_indicators:
    - Empty or missing playbooks directory
    - Responders report no documented procedures for incidents
    - Incident reviews consistently note lack of documentation
    explanation: |
      Without incident playbooks, every incident becomes an ad-hoc
      problem-solving exercise. This leads to inconsistent responses,
      longer resolution times, and missed communication steps.
    remediation: Create playbooks for top 5 most common incident types immediately
  - id: PLAYBOOK-CRIT-002
    signal: Playbooks for critical systems are significantly outdated
    evidence_threshold: Playbook last updated >12 months ago for active system
    explanation: |
      Outdated playbooks may contain incorrect procedures, reference
      deprecated systems, or omit critical steps added after changes.
      Following outdated playbooks during incidents can cause additional harm.
    remediation: Review and update all critical system playbooks within 2 weeks
  high:
  - id: PLAYBOOK-HIGH-001
    signal: Common incident types lack dedicated playbooks
    evidence_indicators:
    - Post-incident reviews cite missing playbooks
    - '>3 incidents of same type without playbook'
    explanation: |
      Recurring incidents without playbooks indicate a systematic gap
      in operational preparedness. Each recurrence without a playbook
      means relearning responses and likely longer resolution.
    remediation: Create playbooks for any incident type occurring more than twice
  - id: PLAYBOOK-HIGH-002
    signal: Playbooks lack clear escalation criteria
    evidence_indicators:
    - No severity thresholds documented
    - Missing escalation contact information
    - No timeline triggers for escalation
    explanation: |
      Without clear escalation criteria, responders either escalate too
      late (extending incident duration) or too early (causing alert fatigue
      for senior staff).
    remediation: Add explicit escalation criteria with time-based triggers
  - id: PLAYBOOK-HIGH-003
    signal: Playbooks not accessible during infrastructure outages
    evidence_indicators:
    - Playbooks stored only in potentially affected systems
    - No offline or backup access method documented
    explanation: |
      If playbooks are stored in systems that may be affected by incidents,
      they may be inaccessible when most needed.
    remediation: Ensure playbooks accessible via multiple independent channels
  medium:
  - id: PLAYBOOK-MED-001
    signal: Playbooks lack communication templates
    explanation: |
      During incidents, responders must communicate with stakeholders while
      troubleshooting. Pre-written templates reduce cognitive load and
      ensure consistent, professional communication.
    remediation: Add status update and stakeholder communication templates
  - id: PLAYBOOK-MED-002
    signal: Playbooks not tested through drills
    remediation: Implement quarterly incident response drills using playbooks
  - id: PLAYBOOK-MED-003
    signal: No playbook feedback or improvement process
    remediation: Add post-incident playbook review to incident closeout
  low:
  - id: PLAYBOOK-LOW-001
    signal: Playbooks stored separately from alerting integration
    remediation: Link playbooks directly from alert definitions
  - id: PLAYBOOK-LOW-002
    signal: Playbook formatting inconsistent across teams
    remediation: Establish organization-wide playbook template
  positive:
  - id: PLAYBOOK-POS-001
    signal: Playbooks exist for all documented incident types
  - id: PLAYBOOK-POS-002
    signal: Playbooks include decision trees for complex scenarios
  - id: PLAYBOOK-POS-003
    signal: Regular tabletop exercises validate playbook effectiveness
