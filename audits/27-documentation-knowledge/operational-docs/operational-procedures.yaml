description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates documentation of standard operating procedures (SOPs)
    for day-to-day system operations. This includes routine maintenance tasks,
    scheduled jobs, access management procedures, capacity management, and
    regular operational activities. The audit examines procedure completeness,
    accuracy, and alignment with actual operational practices.
  why_it_matters: |
    Standard operating procedures ensure consistent, repeatable operations
    across team members and time. Without documented SOPs, operations become
    person-dependent, leading to variations in execution, missed steps, and
    difficulty training new team members. Well-documented procedures also
    support compliance requirements and audit readiness.
  when_to_run:
  - During operational maturity assessments
  - When onboarding new operations staff
  - After operational incidents caused by procedural errors
  - As part of compliance preparation

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PROCEDURES-CRIT-001
    signal: Security-critical procedures are undocumented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Access provisioning done ad-hoc without documented steps
    - Credential rotation lacks documented procedure
    - Audit-required procedures have no documentation
    explanation: |
      Security-critical procedures without documentation create compliance
      risks and potential for inconsistent application of security controls.
    remediation: Document all security-critical procedures within 30 days
  - id: PROCEDURES-CRIT-002
    signal: Procedures for financial-impacting operations are missing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Billing-related operations undocumented
    - Financial reconciliation procedures verbal only
    explanation: |
      Financial operations require documented procedures for audit trails
      and consistent, error-free execution.
    remediation: Immediately document all financial-impacting procedures
  high:
  - id: PROCEDURES-HIGH-001
    signal: Core operational procedures are undocumented
    evidence_threshold: '>50% of routine operations lack documentation'
    explanation: |
      Without documented procedures, operations depend on individual
      knowledge, creating risk during staff transitions and absences.
    remediation: Create procedures for all weekly/monthly operational tasks
  - id: PROCEDURES-HIGH-002
    signal: Documented procedures don't match actual practices
    evidence_indicators:
    - Staff report using different steps than documented
    - Documented commands fail when executed
    - Procedures reference deprecated tools
    explanation: |
      Procedures that don't match reality are worse than no procedures,
      as they create confusion about the authoritative process.
    remediation: Audit and update all procedures to match actual practices
  - id: PROCEDURES-HIGH-003
    signal: No procedure versioning or change tracking
    evidence_indicators:
    - Procedures in wiki without history
    - No way to identify what changed
    - Multiple conflicting versions exist
    explanation: |
      Without version control, it's impossible to know if procedures are
      current or track what changes have been made over time.
    remediation: Migrate procedures to version-controlled repository
  medium:
  - id: PROCEDURES-MED-001
    signal: Procedures lack verification steps
    explanation: |
      Without verification steps, operators cannot confirm successful
      procedure completion, potentially leaving operations incomplete.
    remediation: Add verification/validation steps to all procedures
  - id: PROCEDURES-MED-002
    signal: No procedure ownership or review schedule
    remediation: Assign owners and establish review cadence
  - id: PROCEDURES-MED-003
    signal: Procedures missing prerequisites and access requirements
    remediation: Add prerequisites section to all procedures
  low:
  - id: PROCEDURES-LOW-001
    signal: Procedure documentation scattered across systems
    remediation: Consolidate procedures into single searchable location
  - id: PROCEDURES-LOW-002
    signal: No procedure templates or formatting standards
    remediation: Create and enforce procedure templates
  positive:
  - id: PROCEDURES-POS-001
    signal: All routine operations have documented procedures
  - id: PROCEDURES-POS-002
    signal: Procedures stored in version control with review process
  - id: PROCEDURES-POS-003
    signal: Regular procedure audits and updates scheduled
