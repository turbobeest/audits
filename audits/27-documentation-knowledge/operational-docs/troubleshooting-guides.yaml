  what: |
    This audit evaluates troubleshooting documentation that helps engineers
    diagnose and resolve system issues. This includes diagnostic procedures,
    symptom-to-cause mappings, debugging guides, and common issue resolutions.
    The audit examines whether troubleshooting guides enable efficient problem
    resolution across skill levels.
  why_it_matters: |
    Troubleshooting documentation captures institutional knowledge about
    system behavior and common problems. Without it, engineers repeatedly
    rediscover solutions, extending resolution times and frustrating both
    operators and customers. Good troubleshooting guides accelerate diagnosis,
    enable junior engineers to resolve issues independently, and preserve
    knowledge across team transitions.
  when_to_run:
  - After recurring incidents of the same type
  - When onboarding new team members
  - During operational readiness reviews
  - When MTTR metrics exceed targets

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TROUBLE-CRIT-001
    signal: No troubleshooting documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - Engineers rely entirely on tribal knowledge
    - Same issues repeatedly investigated from scratch
    - No documented diagnostic procedures
    explanation: |
      Without troubleshooting guides, resolution times are extended as
      engineers rediscover solutions. Knowledge is lost when team members
      leave.
    remediation: Create troubleshooting guides for top 10 incident types
  high:
  - id: TROUBLE-HIGH-001
    signal: Common issues lack troubleshooting documentation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Recurring incidents without documented resolution
    - '>3 incidents of same type without guide'
    - Teams repeatedly escalate same issues
    explanation: |
      Recurring issues without documentation indicate failure to capture
      and share operational knowledge.
    remediation: Document all recurring issue types
  - id: TROUBLE-HIGH-002
    signal: Troubleshooting guides outdated or incorrect
    evidence_indicators:
    - Commands fail when executed
    - Referenced tools deprecated
    - Steps don't match current system
    explanation: |
      Incorrect troubleshooting guides waste time and may cause
      additional problems during diagnosis.
    remediation: Review and update all troubleshooting guides
  - id: TROUBLE-HIGH-003
    signal: Troubleshooting knowledge only in individuals' heads
    evidence_indicators:
    - Specific people always contacted for certain issues
    - Knowledge not transferred to documentation
    - Resolution depends on expert availability
    explanation: |
      Tribal knowledge creates single points of failure and prevents
      team scalability.
    remediation: Document expert knowledge systematically
  medium:
  - id: TROUBLE-MED-001
    signal: Troubleshooting guides lack diagnostic commands
    explanation: |
      Without specific commands, engineers must figure out how to
      gather diagnostic information.
    remediation: Add copy-paste diagnostic commands
  - id: TROUBLE-MED-002
    signal: No symptom-to-cause mapping
    remediation: Create symptom index with links to causes
  - id: TROUBLE-MED-003
    signal: Resolution steps lack verification
    remediation: Add verification steps to confirm issue resolution
  low:
  - id: TROUBLE-LOW-001
    signal: Troubleshooting guides not searchable
    remediation: Ensure guides are indexed for search
  - id: TROUBLE-LOW-002
    signal: No troubleshooting guide template
    remediation: Create and enforce consistent template
  positive:
  - id: TROUBLE-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive troubleshooting guides for all services
  - id: TROUBLE-POS-002
    signal: Guides include decision trees for complex issues
  - id: TROUBLE-POS-003
    signal: Post-incident updates to guides are standard practice
