description:
  what: |
    This audit examines automation coverage including:
    - Deployment automation
    - Incident response automation
    - Remediation automation
    - Scaling automation
    - Testing automation
    - Monitoring automation
    - Runbook automation
    - Self-healing capabilities
  why_it_matters: |
    Automation coverage determines operational scalability:
    - Reduces manual intervention
    - Improves consistency
    - Enables faster response
    - Allows team to focus on improvement

    Low automation coverage means operational costs scale
    linearly with service growth, limiting scalability.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly automation reviews
  - When toil increases
  - During efficiency planning
  - After incidents requiring manual work
  - When scaling services
prerequisites:
  required_access:
  - Automation inventory
  - Deployment systems
  - Runbook documentation
  - Incident response tools
  required_knowledge:
  - Operational processes
  - Automation capabilities
  - System architecture
  - Team workflows
discovery:
  inventory_analysis:
  - Catalog existing automation
  - Map processes to automation
  - Identify automation gaps
  - Assess automation quality
  process_review:
  - Review manual processes
  - Identify automation opportunities
  - Assess automation reliability
  - Check automation maintenance
