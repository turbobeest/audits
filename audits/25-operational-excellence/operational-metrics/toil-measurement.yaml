  what: |
    This audit examines toil measurement including:
    - Toil identification practices
    - Toil tracking mechanisms
    - Time spent on toil
    - Toil categorization
    - Toil reduction priorities
    - Automation opportunities
    - Toil trends analysis
    - Team toil distribution
  why_it_matters: |
    Toil measurement enables operational improvement:
    - Identifies automation opportunities
    - Quantifies operational burden
    - Prioritizes improvement efforts
    - Prevents team burnout

    Google SRE defines toil as manual, repetitive, automatable work
    that scales with service growth. Unmeasured toil grows
    unchecked and consumes engineering capacity.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly operational reviews
  - When operational load increases
  - During capacity planning
  - After team structure changes
  - When burnout signals appear
prerequisites:
  required_access:
  - Time tracking systems
  - Ticket/task management
  - Operational logs
  - Team schedules
  required_knowledge:
  - SRE toil definition
  - Operational processes
  - Automation capabilities
  - Team responsibilities
discovery:
  data_analysis:
  - Review time tracking data
  - Analyze ticket categories
  - Examine on-call activities
  - Study deployment tasks
  process_review:
