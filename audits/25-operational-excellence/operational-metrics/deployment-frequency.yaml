description:
  what: |
    This audit examines deployment frequency including:
    - Deployment rate measurement
    - Deployment trends over time
    - Deployment by service/team
    - Deployment batch sizes
    - Deployment timing patterns
    - Failed deployment rate
    - Deployment lead time
    - Comparison to DORA benchmarks
  why_it_matters: |
    Deployment frequency is a key DORA metric:
    - Higher frequency correlates with success
    - Enables faster feedback loops
    - Reduces deployment risk
    - Indicates organizational agility

    The Accelerate research shows elite performers deploy
    on-demand, multiple times per day, while low performers
    deploy weekly to monthly.
  when_to_run:
  - Monthly DevOps metrics reviews
  - Quarterly performance assessments
  - When delivery velocity questioned
  - During DevOps transformation
  - Annual benchmarking
