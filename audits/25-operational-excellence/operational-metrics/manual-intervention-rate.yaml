description:
  what: |
    This audit examines manual intervention rates including:
    - Manual intervention frequency
    - Intervention categories
    - Time spent on interventions
    - Root causes of interventions
    - Intervention trends
    - After-hours interventions
    - Repeat interventions
    - Intervention success rates
  why_it_matters: |
    Manual intervention rate indicates operational maturity:
    - High rates signal automation gaps
    - Interventions disrupt engineer work
    - After-hours interventions affect quality of life
    - Repeat interventions indicate systemic issues

    Reducing manual interventions improves both system
    reliability and team sustainability.
