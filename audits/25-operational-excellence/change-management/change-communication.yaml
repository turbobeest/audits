  what: |
    This audit examines change communication practices including:
    - Pre-change notification procedures
    - Stakeholder identification and communication
    - Change calendar and scheduling visibility
    - Customer notification for impacting changes
    - Internal team coordination
    - Post-change announcements
    - Communication channels and tools
    - Communication timing and cadence
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective change communication prevents surprises and enables coordination:
    - Stakeholders can prepare for potential impacts
    - Dependent teams can align their schedules
    - Customers can plan around maintenance windows
    - Support teams can anticipate questions

    Poor communication leads to confusion, frustrated stakeholders,
    and missed coordination opportunities. ITIL emphasizes communication
    as a key component of successful change management.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly operational reviews
  - When communication complaints arise
  - After change coordination failures
  - When stakeholder groups change
  - During process improvement

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CCM-CRIT-001
    signal: No change communication process exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - Changes deployed without notification
    - Stakeholders learn of changes after the fact
    - No communication procedures defined
    explanation: |
      Without communication, stakeholders are surprised by changes.
      This damages trust, prevents preparation, and misses coordination
      opportunities. All significant changes should be communicated.
    remediation: |
      - Define communication process
      - Identify stakeholder groups
      - Create notification templates
      - Establish communication channels
      - Set communication timing rules
  - id: CCM-CRIT-002
    signal: Customer-impacting changes not communicated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Maintenance windows unannounced
    - Breaking changes surprise customers
    - No customer notification process
    explanation: |
      Customers deserve advance notice of changes that affect them.
      Unannounced changes damage customer trust and may violate SLAs
      or contracts requiring notification.
    remediation: |
      - Define customer notification criteria
      - Create customer communication templates
      - Establish notification timing
      - Configure customer channels
      - Track customer notification compliance
  high:
  - id: CCM-HIGH-001
    signal: Internal team coordination lacking
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dependent teams surprised by changes
    - No shared change calendar
    - Cross-team conflicts common
    explanation: |
      Internal teams need visibility into each other's changes to
      coordinate effectively. Without coordination, conflicting
      changes cause issues and debugging becomes difficult.
    remediation: |
      - Create shared change calendar
      - Define cross-team notification rules
      - Establish coordination meetings
      - Share deployment schedules
      - Enable change visibility
  - id: CCM-HIGH-002
    signal: No pre-change notification timing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Last-minute change announcements
    - Insufficient notice for preparation
    - No standard notification lead time
    explanation: |
      Stakeholders need adequate notice to prepare. Standards for
      notification timing (e.g., 24 hours for minor, 1 week for major)
      enable proper preparation.
    remediation: |
      - Define notification timing standards
      - Set lead time by change category
      - Configure automated reminders
      - Enforce timing compliance
      - Monitor notification adherence
  medium:
  - id: CCM-MED-001
    signal: No communication templates
    evidence_indicators:
    - Ad-hoc notifications created each time
    - Inconsistent communication format
    - Key information sometimes missing
    explanation: |
      Templates ensure consistent, complete communication. Without
      them, quality varies and critical information may be omitted.
    remediation: |
      - Create notification templates
      - Include required information fields
      - Template by change type
      - Review and update templates
      - Train on template usage
  - id: CCM-MED-002
    signal: Post-change communication lacking
    evidence_indicators:
    - No completion announcements
    - Stakeholders don't know when changes finish
    - Success/failure not communicated
    explanation: |
      Post-change communication closes the loop. Stakeholders need
      to know when changes complete, whether successful, and any
      follow-up required.
    remediation: |
      - Add post-change notification
      - Include outcome status
      - Note any follow-up needed
      - Time promptly after completion
      - Include in standard process
  low:
  - id: CCM-LOW-001
    signal: Communication effectiveness not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - Stakeholder awareness unknown
    - Communication quality not assessed
    - No feedback mechanism
    explanation: |
      Measuring effectiveness enables improvement. Feedback from
      stakeholders identifies communication gaps and opportunities.
    remediation: |
      - Survey stakeholder satisfaction
      - Collect communication feedback
      - Track missed notifications
      - Report communication metrics
      - Improve based on feedback
  positive:
  - id: CCM-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive change communication process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Stakeholders identified and notified
    - Timing standards followed
    - Templates ensure consistency
  - id: CCM-POS-002
    signal: Proactive customer communication
    evidence_indicators:
    - Customer-impacting changes announced
    - Adequate notice provided
    - Multiple channels used
