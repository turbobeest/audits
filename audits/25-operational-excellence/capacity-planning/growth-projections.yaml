  what: |
    This audit examines growth projection practices including:
    - Business growth forecast integration
    - User growth modeling
    - Data growth projections
    - Feature launch impact planning
    - Regional expansion planning
    - Growth rate assumptions
    - Projection accuracy tracking
    - Multi-scenario growth planning
  why_it_matters: |
    Business growth directly drives capacity needs:
    - User growth requires proportional capacity
    - Feature launches change resource requirements
    - Geographic expansion needs new capacity
    - Accurate projections prevent capacity emergencies

    Disconnected growth and capacity planning leads to either shortages
    or over-provisioning. Integration ensures capacity matches business.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly business planning
  - Annual budget cycles
  - Before major launches
  - When growth assumptions change
  - During capacity planning
signals:
  critical:
  - id: GP-CRIT-001
    signal: No business growth integrated with capacity
    evidence_indicators:
    - Capacity planning ignores business forecasts
    - Growth rates not considered
    - Launches surprise capacity team
    remediation: |
      - Integrate with business planning
      - Include growth in capacity models
      - Coordinate on launches
      - Track growth projections
      - Adjust capacity accordingly
  high:
  - id: GP-HIGH-001
    signal: Feature launches not capacity planned
    evidence_indicators:
    - New features stress capacity
    - Launch impact not estimated
    - No capacity allocation for launches
    remediation: |
      - Include launches in planning
      - Estimate feature resource needs
      - Pre-provision for launches
      - Monitor launch impact
      - Adjust based on actuals
