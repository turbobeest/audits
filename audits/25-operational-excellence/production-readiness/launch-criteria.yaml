description:
  what: |
    This audit examines launch criteria including:
    - Go/no-go criteria definition
    - Quality gates and thresholds
    - Performance baselines
    - Security approval requirements
    - Compliance sign-offs
    - Stakeholder approval process
    - Launch window criteria
    - Conditional launch criteria
  why_it_matters: |
    Clear launch criteria ensure consistent decisions:
    - Objective basis for launch decisions
    - Prevents premature launches
    - Stakeholder alignment on standards
    - Reduces launch-related incidents

    Undefined criteria lead to subjective decisions,
    inconsistent quality, and preventable launch failures.
  when_to_run:
  - When defining launch process
  - Before major launches
  - After launch incidents
  - During process reviews
  - When quality varies
prerequisites:
  required_access:
  - Launch criteria documentation
  - Quality gate definitions
  - Historical launch decisions
  - Post-launch metrics
  required_knowledge:
  - Quality standards
  - Performance requirements
  - Security requirements
  - Compliance obligations
discovery:
  documentation_review:
  - Review launch criteria
  - Examine quality gates
  - Check threshold definitions
  - Analyze approval requirements
  process_analysis:
  - Interview launch decision makers
  - Review historical launches
  - Check criteria enforcement
  - Analyze launch outcomes
