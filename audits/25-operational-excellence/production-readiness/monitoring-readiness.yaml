  what: |
    This audit examines monitoring readiness including:
    - Metrics collection and coverage
    - Alerting configuration
    - Dashboard availability
    - Log aggregation setup
    - Distributed tracing
    - SLI measurement implementation
    - On-call integration
    - Runbook linking
  why_it_matters: |
    Monitoring readiness is essential for production:
    - Enables issue detection before users notice
    - Supports effective incident response
    - Provides data for optimization
    - Required for SLO tracking

    Services without adequate monitoring are flying blind,
    unable to detect or diagnose production issues effectively.
  when_to_run:
  - Before service launches
  - Before major releases
  - After monitoring gaps discovered
  - During observability reviews
  - Quarterly assessments
