  what: |
    This audit examines pager load distribution including:
    - Alert volume per team member
    - Weekend and holiday distribution
    - Incident severity distribution
    - Time of day distribution
    - Compensation alignment with load
    - Load balancing algorithms
    - Historical trend analysis
    - Load anomaly detection
  why_it_matters: |
    Fair load distribution is essential for team sustainability:
    - Uneven distribution causes burnout for overloaded members
    - Unfair weekend/holiday assignment creates resentment
    - High-load periods without compensation reduce morale
    - Imbalance leads to attrition of top performers

    Google SRE emphasizes that on-call load should be distributed
    evenly and should not exceed 25% of any individual's time.
    Tracking load enables proactive adjustment before problems emerge.
  when_to_run:
  - Monthly operational reviews
  - When team complaints arise
  - After rotation changes
  - During compensation reviews
  - When planning hiring

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PLB-CRIT-001
    signal: Severe load imbalance across team members
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some members receive 3x+ more pages than others
    - Single person handles majority of incidents
    - Load distribution highly skewed
    explanation: |
      Severe imbalance indicates either rotation misconfiguration or
      alert routing issues. Overloaded members experience burnout while
      underloaded members lack experience. Distribution should be within
      20% variance.
    remediation: |
      - Audit rotation configuration
      - Check alert routing rules
      - Implement load-aware scheduling
      - Balance high-volume shifts
      - Monitor distribution monthly
  - id: PLB-CRIT-002
    signal: Individual on-call load exceeds 25%
    evidence_indicators:
    - Team member on-call more than 25% of time
    - Insufficient team size for coverage
    - Single points of failure in rotation
    explanation: |
      Google SRE recommends no individual be on-call more than 25% of
      the time for sustainability. Higher percentages indicate team
      understaffing or rotation configuration issues.
    remediation: |
      - Expand team size if understaffed
      - Distribute coverage more evenly
      - Consider follow-the-sun coverage
      - Reduce on-call scope
      - Automate to reduce burden
  high:
  - id: PLB-HIGH-001
    signal: Weekend/holiday load unfairly distributed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same people always cover weekends
    - Holiday coverage not rotated
    - New team members avoid off-hours
    explanation: |
      Weekend and holiday coverage is more disruptive than weekday.
      Fair distribution ensures no one consistently bears off-hours
      burden while others only cover business hours.
    remediation: |
      - Track weekend/holiday distribution
      - Rotate off-hours coverage evenly
      - Include in compensation calculation
      - Prevent opt-outs from off-hours
      - Balance across calendar year
  - id: PLB-HIGH-002
    signal: High-severity incidents concentrated on few members
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical incidents handled by same people
    - Severity distribution skewed by person
    - Experience gap in handling major incidents
    explanation: |
      Concentrated critical incident experience creates knowledge silos
      and burnout for those handling severe incidents. All team members
      should gain experience with various severity levels.
    remediation: |
      - Track severity distribution by person
      - Rotate critical incident handling
      - Pair experienced with learning responders
      - Balance high-stress shifts
      - Share institutional knowledge
  medium:
  - id: PLB-MED-001
    signal: Load metrics not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No load distribution data available
    - Fairness unknown
    - No reporting on distribution
    explanation: |
      Without metrics, load problems go unnoticed until they cause
      visible issues. Tracking enables proactive rebalancing before
      burnout or attrition occur.
    remediation: |
      - Implement load tracking
      - Generate distribution reports
      - Set balance targets
      - Review metrics monthly
      - Alert on imbalance thresholds
  - id: PLB-MED-002
    signal: No load-aware scheduling
    evidence_indicators:
    - Round-robin only, ignoring load
    - No adjustment for high-volume periods
    - Shift assignment doesn't consider past load
    explanation: |
      Simple round-robin scheduling ignores that some shifts have higher
      volume than others. Load-aware scheduling balances cumulative load
      rather than just shift count.
    remediation: |
      - Implement load-aware scheduling
      - Weight shifts by historical volume
      - Adjust for time-of-day patterns
      - Consider incident severity weight
      - Balance cumulative load quarterly
  low:
  - id: PLB-LOW-001
    signal: Compensation not aligned with load
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same compensation regardless of pages
    - High-load members not recognized
    - No variable compensation component
    explanation: |
      Compensation should reflect actual burden. Members handling more
      incidents should receive proportional recognition or compensation.
    remediation: |
      - Track load for compensation purposes
      - Implement variable on-call pay
      - Recognize high-load contributors
      - Align comp time with actual incidents
      - Review compensation policy
  positive:
  - id: PLB-POS-001
    signal: Even load distribution with tracking
    evidence_indicators:
    - Load variance within 20%
    - Weekend/holiday evenly distributed
    - Distribution actively monitored
  - id: PLB-POS-002
    signal: Load-aware scheduling implemented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Historical load considered in scheduling
    - High-volume shifts balanced
    - Compensation aligned with actual load
