description:
  what: |
    This audit examines SLO definitions including:
    - SLO existence for critical services
    - SLO clarity and specificity
    - SLI-to-SLO mapping
    - Target value appropriateness
    - Business alignment of objectives
    - Time window definitions
    - SLO documentation completeness
    - Stakeholder agreement
  why_it_matters: |
    SLOs are the foundation of reliability management:
    - Define acceptable reliability levels
    - Enable error budget management
    - Guide engineering prioritization
    - Align operations with business needs

    Google SRE defines SLOs as the most important feature of the
    SRE model. Without SLOs, there's no objective basis for
    reliability decisions or prioritization.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly SLO reviews
  - When launching new services
  - After reliability incidents
  - During service ownership changes
  - When business requirements change
signals:
  critical:
  - id: SLOD-CRIT-001
    signal: No SLOs defined for critical services
    evidence_indicators:
    - No SLO documentation found
    - Services lack reliability targets
    - No objectives for user experience
    remediation: |
      - Define SLOs for all critical services
      - Start with availability and latency
      - Get stakeholder agreement
      - Document and publish SLOs
      - Begin tracking compliance
  - id: SLOD-CRIT-002
    signal: SLOs not measurable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Subjective SLO definitions
    - No associated SLIs
    - Cannot determine compliance
    remediation: |
      - Define measurable SLIs for each SLO
      - Specify exact measurement method
      - Implement measurement automation
      - Validate measurement accuracy
      - Document measurement methodology
  high:
  - id: SLOD-HIGH-001
    signal: SLOs not aligned with business requirements
    evidence_indicators:
    - Technical-only SLOs
    - No business input on targets
    - SLOs don't reflect user needs
    remediation: |
      - Engage business stakeholders
      - Understand user expectations
      - Align SLOs with contracts/SLAs
      - Document business rationale
      - Review alignment periodically
  - id: SLOD-HIGH-002
    signal: SLO targets unrealistic
    evidence_indicators:
    - Targets never achieved
    - 100% availability targets
    - No historical basis for targets
    remediation: |
      - Base targets on historical data
      - Avoid perfection targets
      - Start with achievable targets
      - Improve incrementally
      - Balance cost and reliability
