description:
  what: |
    This audit examines SLI measurement including:
    - SLI definition clarity
    - Measurement implementation
    - Data collection accuracy
    - Measurement consistency
    - Dashboard and reporting
    - Real user vs synthetic measurement
    - SLI granularity
    - Measurement gaps
  why_it_matters: |
    Accurate SLIs are essential for meaningful SLOs:
    - Inaccurate SLIs lead to wrong decisions
    - Missing data skews reliability perception
    - Inconsistent measurement prevents comparison
    - User-facing SLIs reflect actual experience

    Without accurate measurement, SLO compliance is meaningless
    and error budget management fails.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly SLO reviews
  - After measurement changes
  - When SLI accuracy questioned
  - During reliability assessments
  - After infrastructure changes
signals:
  critical:
  - id: SLIM-CRIT-001
    signal: SLIs not implemented or measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No SLI metrics collected
    - SLOs defined but not tracked
    - No measurement infrastructure
    remediation: |
      - Implement SLI measurement
      - Configure metric collection
      - Create SLI dashboards
      - Validate measurement accuracy
      - Automate SLI reporting
  - id: SLIM-CRIT-002
    signal: SLI measurement significantly inaccurate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Metrics don't match user experience
    - Measurement gaps during incidents
    - Systematic measurement errors
    remediation: |
      - Audit measurement accuracy
      - Fix measurement gaps
      - Validate against user experience
      - Implement end-to-end measurement
      - Monitor measurement health
  high:
  - id: SLIM-HIGH-001
    signal: SLIs measured at wrong layer
    evidence_indicators:
    - Infrastructure metrics only
    - Missing user-perspective measurement
    - Internal metrics vs user experience
    remediation: |
      - Measure at user boundary
      - Include real user monitoring
      - Add synthetic monitoring
      - Correlate with user complaints
      - Validate measurement perspective
