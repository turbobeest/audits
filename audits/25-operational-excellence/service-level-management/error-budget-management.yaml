  what: |
    This audit examines error budget management including:
    - Error budget calculation
    - Budget tracking and reporting
    - Budget burn rate monitoring
    - Budget exhaustion policies
    - Feature freeze triggers
    - Budget allocation decisions
    - Historical budget consumption
    - Stakeholder communication
  why_it_matters: |
    Error budgets enable rational reliability decisions:
    - Quantify acceptable unreliability
    - Balance velocity with stability
    - Trigger reliability focus when needed
    - Justify reliability investments

    Google SRE uses error budgets to resolve conflicts between
    feature development and reliability work. Without budgets,
    these decisions become political rather than data-driven.
  when_to_run:
  - Monthly error budget reviews
  - When budget approaching exhaustion
  - Quarterly SLO reviews
  - After reliability incidents
  - During sprint planning
signals:
  critical:
  - id: EBM-CRIT-001
    signal: No error budget tracking
    evidence_indicators:
    - SLOs exist but no budget
    - No budget calculation
    - Budget consumption unknown
    remediation: |
      - Calculate error budget from SLOs
      - Implement budget tracking
      - Create budget dashboards
      - Report budget status regularly
      - Alert on budget burn rate
  - id: EBM-CRIT-002
    signal: Budget exhausted with no action
    evidence_indicators:
    - Zero or negative budget
    - No reliability focus triggered
    - Continued feature releases
    remediation: |
      - Define budget exhaustion policies
      - Implement feature freeze triggers
      - Prioritize reliability work
      - Communicate budget status
      - Track recovery to positive budget
  high:
  - id: EBM-HIGH-001
    signal: No budget exhaustion policies
    evidence_indicators:
    - No defined response to budget exhaustion
    - No feature freeze criteria
    - Budget treated as informational only
    remediation: |
      - Define exhaustion policies
      - Set feature freeze thresholds
      - Agree policies with stakeholders
      - Document and publish policies
      - Enforce policies consistently
