  what: |
    This audit examines incident tracking practices including:
    - Incident tracking system selection and configuration
    - Incident lifecycle state management
    - Data fields and metadata captured
    - Integration with alerting and monitoring
    - Incident categorization and tagging
    - Historical data retention and searchability
    - Reporting and analytics capabilities
    - Cross-team visibility and access
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective incident tracking provides operational visibility and enables improvement:
    - Complete records support post-incident analysis
    - Searchable history prevents reinventing solutions
    - Accurate categorization enables pattern analysis
    - Integration reduces manual data entry and errors

    Without proper tracking, organizations lose institutional knowledge,
    repeat investigations for similar issues, and cannot demonstrate
    compliance with SLA commitments. ITIL emphasizes that incident
    records are essential for trend analysis and problem management.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly operational reviews
  - When incident data quality issues arise
  - Before compliance audits
  - When evaluating tracking tools
  - During process improvement initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: IT-CRIT-001
    signal: No centralized incident tracking system
    evidence_indicators:
    - Incidents tracked in spreadsheets or email
    - No dedicated incident tracking tool
    - Incidents recorded inconsistently
    explanation: |
      Without a centralized tracking system, incidents are lost, duplicated,
      or inconsistently handled. A proper tracking system provides audit
      trails, enables automation, and supports analysis for improvement.
    remediation: |
      - Implement dedicated incident tracking tool
      - Configure incident lifecycle states
      - Define required data fields
      - Train team on consistent usage
      - Migrate historical data
  - id: IT-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical incident data not captured
    evidence_indicators:
    - Missing severity/priority fields
    - No timestamps for lifecycle events
    - Impact not recorded
    explanation: |
      Incident records without critical data fields cannot support analysis,
      reporting, or compliance. At minimum, incidents must capture severity,
      timestamps, impact, and resolution details.
    remediation: |
      - Define mandatory incident fields
      - Configure field validation
      - Automate timestamp capture
      - Train responders on data entry
      - Audit data quality regularly
  high:
  - id: IT-HIGH-001
    signal: Incident tracking not integrated with alerting
    evidence_indicators:
    - Manual incident creation from alerts
    - Alert context not captured in incidents
    - No correlation between alerts and incidents
    explanation: |
      Manual incident creation loses context and delays response. Integration
      with alerting systems ensures incidents are created with full context
      and enables alert-to-incident correlation.
    remediation: |
      - Configure automatic incident creation from alerts
      - Include alert details in incident records
      - Enable alert grouping into incidents
      - Link related alerts to incidents
      - Preserve monitoring context
  - id: IT-HIGH-002
    signal: Incident lifecycle states poorly defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only 'open' and 'closed' states
    - No state for acknowledgment or investigation
    - State transitions not enforced
    explanation: |
      Rich lifecycle states enable accurate tracking and reporting. States
      like 'acknowledged', 'investigating', 'mitigated', and 'resolved'
      provide visibility into incident progress and enable workflow automation.
    remediation: |
      - Define incident lifecycle states
      - Configure state transition rules
      - Enforce required transitions
      - Track time in each state
      - Automate state notifications
  - id: IT-HIGH-003
    signal: No incident categorization or tagging
    evidence_indicators:
    - All incidents categorized the same
    - No service or component tagging
    - Root cause categories missing
    explanation: |
      Categorization enables pattern analysis, service-level reporting,
      and problem management. Without categorization, trend analysis
      and targeted improvements are impossible.
    remediation: |
      - Define incident categories
      - Implement service/component tagging
      - Create root cause taxonomy
      - Train on consistent categorization
      - Review and refine categories quarterly
  medium:
  - id: IT-MED-001
    signal: Historical incidents not searchable
    evidence_indicators:
    - No full-text search capability
    - Limited filtering options
    - Old incidents not accessible
    explanation: |
      Searchable incident history enables rapid diagnosis by finding similar
      past incidents. This accelerates resolution and prevents reinventing
      solutions for recurring issues.
    remediation: |
      - Enable full-text search
      - Implement filtering by category, service, date
      - Ensure data retention supports search
      - Index incident summaries and resolutions
      - Train team on search capabilities
  - id: IT-MED-002
    signal: Cross-team visibility limited
    evidence_indicators:
    - Incidents visible only to owning team
    - No shared incident view
    - Dependent teams unaware of incidents
    explanation: |
      Limited visibility prevents dependent teams from understanding
      service status and delays coordinated response. Incidents affecting
      shared services should be visible to all stakeholders.
    remediation: |
      - Configure cross-team incident visibility
      - Create shared dashboards
      - Implement notification to dependent teams
      - Enable read access across teams
      - Maintain security for sensitive incidents
  low:
  - id: IT-LOW-001
    signal: Incident data not used for problem management
    evidence_indicators:
    - No link between incidents and problem records
    - Recurring incidents not identified
    - Root cause patterns not analyzed
    explanation: |
      Incident data should feed problem management processes. Identifying
      recurring incidents enables proactive problem resolution rather
      than reactive incident handling.
    remediation: |
      - Link incidents to problem records
      - Identify recurring incident patterns
      - Create problems from repeated incidents
      - Track problem resolution impact
      - Report incident reduction from problems
  positive:
  - id: IT-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive incident tracking system
    evidence_indicators:
    - Centralized tracking with rich data capture
    - Integration with alerting and monitoring
    - Searchable historical records
  - id: IT-POS-002
    signal: Incident data drives continuous improvement
    evidence_indicators:
    - Regular incident pattern analysis
    - Problem management linked to incidents
    - Categorization used for improvement targeting
