  what: |
    This audit examines the organization's incident response process for:
    - Incident detection and alerting mechanisms
    - Defined roles and responsibilities (Incident Commander, Communications Lead, etc.)
    - Response playbooks and decision trees
    - Communication channels and protocols
    - Coordination procedures across teams
    - Severity classification and prioritization
    - Incident lifecycle management
    - Integration with monitoring and alerting systems
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective incident response directly impacts service reliability and business continuity:
    - Google SRE book identifies incident management as critical to achieving reliability targets
    - Poorly coordinated responses extend outages and increase customer impact
    - Clear roles and communication reduce confusion during high-stress situations
    - Documented processes enable consistent responses regardless of who is on-call
    - MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) correlates strongly with incident process maturity

    Organizations with mature incident response processes typically achieve:
    - 50-70% reduction in incident duration
    - Improved team morale through reduced chaos
    - Better customer communication during outages
    - Continuous improvement through structured learning
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly operational reviews
  - After major incidents (P0/P1)
  - During SRE team onboarding
  - Before production launches
  - During compliance audits (SOC 2, ISO 27001)

signals:
  critical:
  - id: IRP-CRIT-001
    signal: No documented incident response process exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No incident runbooks or playbooks found
    - No defined incident roles or responsibilities
    - No incident communication templates
    explanation: |
      Without a documented incident response process, teams respond ad-hoc during
      outages, leading to longer resolution times, miscommunication, and repeated
      mistakes. Google SRE practices emphasize that incident management must be
      explicitly designed, not emergent.
    remediation: |
      - Document incident response roles (IC, Communications Lead, Tech Lead)
      - Create incident severity definitions with response expectations
      - Develop communication templates for stakeholders
      - Establish incident channels and coordination procedures
      - Train all on-call personnel on the process
  - id: IRP-CRIT-002
    signal: No incident severity classification system
    evidence_indicators:
    - All incidents treated with same urgency
    - No defined SLA per severity level
    - No escalation criteria based on severity
    explanation: |
      Without severity classification, critical outages may receive insufficient
      attention while minor issues consume disproportionate resources. ITIL and
      SRE frameworks both emphasize that incidents must be classified to enable
      appropriate response allocation.
    remediation: |
      - Define 4-5 severity levels (e.g., SEV1-SEV5 or P0-P4)
      - Document impact criteria for each level
      - Specify response time expectations per level
      - Configure alerting to reflect severity
      - Train teams on classification decisions
  high:
  - id: IRP-HIGH-001
    signal: Incident roles and responsibilities undefined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No Incident Commander role defined
    - Unclear ownership during incidents
    - Multiple people performing same tasks
    explanation: |
      Undefined roles lead to confusion, duplicated effort, and gaps in response.
      The PagerDuty Incident Response guide emphasizes clear role separation
      including Incident Commander, Scribe, Communications Lead, and Subject
      Matter Experts.
    remediation: |
      - Define Incident Commander responsibilities
      - Establish Communications Lead role
      - Document Subject Matter Expert engagement process
      - Create role assignment procedures
      - Practice role transitions in incident simulations
  - id: IRP-HIGH-002
    signal: No incident communication protocols
    evidence_indicators:
    - Ad-hoc status updates during outages
    - Inconsistent stakeholder notification
    - No communication templates exist
    explanation: |
      Poor communication during incidents damages customer trust and creates
      internal confusion. Stakeholders need timely, consistent updates through
      established channels.
    remediation: |
      - Create status page update templates
      - Define communication cadence by severity
      - Establish internal and external communication channels
      - Document escalation for communication decisions
      - Implement automated status page updates
  - id: IRP-HIGH-003
    signal: Incident tooling not integrated with monitoring
    evidence_indicators:
    - Manual incident creation from alerts
    - No automatic alert-to-incident correlation
    - Disconnected monitoring and incident systems
    explanation: |
      Manual incident creation delays response and loses context. Modern incident
      management requires tight integration between monitoring, alerting, and
      incident tracking systems.
    remediation: |
      - Configure automatic incident creation from critical alerts
      - Implement alert grouping and correlation
      - Link monitoring dashboards in incident tickets
      - Automate initial triage information collection
      - Set up bidirectional sync between tools
  medium:
  - id: IRP-MED-001
    signal: Incident response not regularly practiced
    evidence_indicators:
    - No incident drills or game days
    - Inconsistent process execution
    - Confusion during actual incidents
    explanation: |
      Like any emergency procedure, incident response requires practice. Teams
      that don't regularly drill their processes perform poorly during actual
      incidents. Google recommends regular "wheel of misfortune" exercises.
    remediation: |
      - Schedule monthly incident drills
      - Conduct quarterly game days
      - Review process after each drill
      - Track process adherence metrics
      - Update documentation based on learnings
  - id: IRP-MED-002
    signal: No incident timeline tracking
    evidence_indicators:
    - Incident timelines reconstructed from memory
    - No automated timeline capture
    - Missing key events in incident records
    explanation: |
      Accurate timelines are essential for post-incident analysis and identifying
      improvement opportunities. Manual reconstruction is error-prone and
      time-consuming.
    remediation: |
      - Implement automated timeline capture
      - Train team on timeline annotation
      - Use dedicated scribe role during incidents
      - Integrate timeline with incident tools
      - Review timeline completeness post-incident
  low:
  - id: IRP-LOW-001
    signal: Incident response metrics not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No MTTA/MTTR tracking
    - Incident frequency unknown
    - No trend analysis performed
    explanation: |
      Without metrics, organizations cannot identify improvement opportunities
      or demonstrate progress. Key metrics include MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge),
      MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve), and incident frequency by category.
    remediation: |
      - Implement MTTA and MTTR tracking
      - Create incident frequency dashboards
      - Analyze trends monthly
      - Set improvement targets
      - Report metrics to leadership
  positive:
  - id: IRP-POS-001
    signal: Mature incident response process with defined roles
    evidence_indicators:
    - Documented incident roles and responsibilities
    - Clear severity classification system
    - Communication templates and protocols
    - Regular incident drills conducted
  - id: IRP-POS-002
    signal: Integrated incident management tooling
    evidence_indicators:
    - Automatic incident creation from alerts
    - Timeline capture and annotation
    - Stakeholder notification automation
