  what: |
    This audit examines post-incident review processes including:
    - Post-mortem/retrospective procedures and templates
    - Blameless culture implementation
    - Root cause analysis methodologies
    - Action item tracking and completion
    - Learning dissemination across teams
    - Review meeting facilitation
    - Documentation standards and archival
    - Review completion SLAs
  why_it_matters: |
    Post-incident reviews transform incidents into learning opportunities:
    - Google SRE identifies blameless postmortems as critical to building reliable systems
    - Without systematic review, the same incidents recur
    - Action items without tracking become lost opportunities
    - Sharing learnings prevents other teams from making similar mistakes

    Research shows organizations with mature post-incident review processes:
    - Reduce repeat incidents by 40-60%
    - Improve system design through accumulated learning
    - Build psychological safety that enables honest reporting
    - Create institutional knowledge that survives team changes
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly operational reviews
  - After concerns about review quality
  - When action item completion rates drop
  - During team retrospectives
  - When reviewing incident patterns

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PIR-CRIT-001
    signal: No post-incident review process exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No postmortem templates or documentation
    - Incidents closed without review
    - No learning extracted from incidents
    explanation: |
      Without post-incident reviews, organizations repeat the same mistakes.
      Google SRE emphasizes that postmortems are "how we learn" and that
      "incidents from which we do not learn are a waste." Every significant
      incident should result in documented learning.
    remediation: |
      - Create blameless postmortem template
      - Define review criteria (which incidents require review)
      - Establish review completion SLA
      - Train facilitators in blameless technique
      - Archive all reviews for future reference
  - id: PIR-CRIT-002
    signal: Post-incident reviews are blame-focused
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reviews focus on 'who' rather than 'what'
    - Individuals named as root causes
    - Punitive actions result from reviews
    explanation: |
      Blame-focused reviews create fear, suppress honest reporting, and fail
      to identify systemic issues. The Google SRE book emphasizes that
      "blameless postmortems are a tenet of SRE culture" because systems
      should be designed to prevent human error, not punish it.
    remediation: |
      - Train all participants in blameless methodology
      - Reframe language from blame to learning
      - Focus on system improvements, not human failings
      - Explicitly prohibit punitive outcomes from reviews
      - Model blameless behavior from leadership
  high:
  - id: PIR-HIGH-001
    signal: Action items not tracked to completion
    evidence_indicators:
    - Action items recorded but not followed up
    - No completion rate metrics
    - Repeat incidents from unaddressed actions
    explanation: |
      Post-incident reviews that generate untracked action items provide
      the appearance of improvement without actual change. Action items
      must be assigned, prioritized, and tracked to completion to prevent
      incident recurrence.
    remediation: |
      - Integrate action items with work tracking system
      - Assign owners to all action items
      - Set due dates based on risk
      - Review action item completion weekly
      - Report completion rates to leadership
  - id: PIR-HIGH-002
    signal: Post-incident reviews not conducted timely
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reviews delayed weeks after incidents
    - Details forgotten before review
    - No review SLA defined
    explanation: |
      Delayed reviews suffer from fading memory and lost context. Google
      recommends conducting postmortems within 5 business days of incident
      resolution while details are fresh.
    remediation: |
      - Define review SLA (e.g., within 5 business days)
      - Schedule review meeting during incident closeout
      - Preserve timeline and evidence immediately
      - Track review SLA adherence
      - Escalate overdue reviews
  - id: PIR-HIGH-003
    signal: Root cause analysis is superficial
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single obvious cause identified
    - No systematic analysis methodology
    - Contributing factors not explored
    explanation: |
      Superficial analysis addresses symptoms rather than underlying causes.
      Techniques like Five Whys, Fishbone diagrams, or contributing factor
      analysis reveal the systemic issues that enable incidents.
    remediation: |
      - Train teams on root cause analysis techniques
      - Require multiple contributing factors
      - Use structured analysis frameworks
      - Challenge single-cause explanations
      - Document analysis methodology in template
  medium:
  - id: PIR-MED-001
    signal: Learnings not shared across organization
    evidence_indicators:
    - Postmortems only visible to involved team
    - No learning dissemination process
    - Other teams repeat similar mistakes
    explanation: |
      Siloed learning limits the value of post-incident reviews. When
      learnings are shared, other teams can proactively apply improvements
      before experiencing similar incidents.
    remediation: |
      - Publish postmortems in shared repository
      - Create regular learning sharing sessions
      - Summarize key learnings in newsletter
      - Tag postmortems for searchability
      - Cross-reference related incidents
  - id: PIR-MED-002
    signal: No postmortem quality review
    evidence_indicators:
    - Inconsistent postmortem depth
    - No peer review of postmortems
    - Quality varies significantly
    explanation: |
      Without quality review, postmortem effectiveness varies with author
      skill and motivation. Review ensures consistent depth and actionable
      outcomes across all incidents.
    remediation: |
      - Implement postmortem peer review
      - Create quality checklist
      - Provide feedback to authors
      - Recognize high-quality postmortems
      - Coach on improvement areas
  low:
  - id: PIR-LOW-001
    signal: Postmortem metrics not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - Review completion rate unknown
    - Action item closure rate not measured
    - Time to review not tracked
    explanation: |
      Without metrics, organizations cannot assess postmortem process
      effectiveness or identify improvement opportunities. Key metrics
      include completion rate, time to review, and action item closure.
    remediation: |
      - Track postmortem completion rate
      - Measure time from incident to review
      - Monitor action item closure rate
      - Report metrics monthly
      - Set improvement targets
  positive:
  - id: PIR-POS-001
    signal: Mature blameless postmortem culture
    evidence_indicators:
    - Blameless methodology consistently applied
    - High postmortem completion rate
    - Action items tracked to completion
    - Learnings shared organization-wide
  - id: PIR-POS-002
    signal: Systematic root cause analysis
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple contributing factors identified
    - Structured analysis methodology used
    - Systemic improvements prioritized
