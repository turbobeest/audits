  what: |
    This audit examines escalation procedures including:
    - Escalation path definitions (functional, hierarchical, executive)
    - Escalation triggers and timing criteria
    - Contact information accuracy and accessibility
    - Automated vs manual escalation mechanisms
    - Cross-team escalation procedures
    - Vendor and third-party escalation paths
    - Escalation documentation and runbooks
    - Escalation testing and validation
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective escalation ensures incidents reach the right responders quickly:
    - Delays in engaging Subject Matter Experts extend outages
    - Missing escalation paths leave responders without support
    - Incorrect escalation wastes time and causes confusion
    - Untested escalation paths may fail during actual incidents

    According to the Google SRE book, clear escalation paths are essential
    for managing incidents effectively. PagerDuty research shows that
    organizations with well-defined escalation procedures achieve
    significantly faster resolution times.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly operational reviews
  - After incidents with escalation failures
  - When team structures change
  - After on-call rotation changes
  - During vendor relationship reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: EP-CRIT-001
    signal: No escalation paths defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No escalation documentation exists
    - On-call has no backup or escalation
    - No escalation policies in incident tools
    explanation: |
      Without defined escalation paths, on-call responders have no support when
      facing unfamiliar issues. This leads to extended outages, responder burnout,
      and inconsistent incident handling. Google SRE principles require clear
      escalation mechanisms for all services.
    remediation: |
      - Define primary, secondary, and tertiary escalation tiers
      - Document Subject Matter Expert escalation paths
      - Configure escalation policies in incident tools
      - Establish management escalation criteria
      - Test escalation paths monthly
  - id: EP-CRIT-002
    signal: Escalation contact information is outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Contact lists not updated in >3 months
    - Departed employees still on escalation paths
    - Phone numbers and emails invalid
    explanation: |
      Outdated contact information causes escalation failures during critical
      incidents. Responders unable to reach escalation contacts experience
      delayed resolution and increased stress.
    remediation: |
      - Implement automated contact validation
      - Require monthly contact information review
      - Integrate with HR for automatic updates
      - Test contact reachability regularly
      - Document contact update procedures
  high:
  - id: EP-HIGH-001
    signal: No automatic escalation configured
    evidence_indicators:
    - All escalation requires manual action
    - No timeout-based escalation
    - Unacknowledged alerts don't escalate
    explanation: |
      Manual-only escalation fails when primary responders are unavailable or
      overwhelmed. Automatic escalation ensures incidents reach responders
      even if initial contacts cannot respond.
    remediation: |
      - Configure automatic escalation after acknowledgment timeout
      - Set escalation delays appropriate to severity
      - Implement escalation for unresolved incidents
      - Test automatic escalation regularly
      - Monitor escalation policy execution
  - id: EP-HIGH-002
    signal: No executive or management escalation path
    evidence_indicators:
    - Technical escalation only
    - No business impact escalation
    - Executives not notified of major incidents
    explanation: |
      Major incidents often require business decisions, customer communication,
      and resource authorization that require management involvement. Without
      management escalation paths, these decisions are delayed.
    remediation: |
      - Define management escalation criteria
      - Document executive notification thresholds
      - Create management on-call rotation
      - Establish communication protocols for executives
      - Test management escalation quarterly
  - id: EP-HIGH-003
    signal: Cross-team escalation procedures missing
    evidence_indicators:
    - No inter-team escalation documentation
    - Unknown contacts for dependent services
    - Escalation stops at team boundaries
    explanation: |
      Modern systems involve multiple teams. When incidents span teams,
      unclear cross-team escalation causes delays and confusion. Each
      team should know how to escalate to dependent service teams.
    remediation: |
      - Map service dependencies to team ownership
      - Document cross-team escalation contacts
      - Establish inter-team communication protocols
      - Create shared incident channels
      - Practice cross-team incident response
  medium:
  - id: EP-MED-001
    signal: Vendor escalation paths not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No third-party support contacts documented
    - Vendor escalation procedures unknown
    - Support contract details inaccessible
    explanation: |
      Incidents involving third-party services require vendor escalation.
      Without documented vendor contacts and support procedures, responders
      waste time finding the right escalation path during outages.
    remediation: |
      - Document all vendor support contacts
      - Record support contract details (SLA, tier)
      - Create vendor escalation runbooks
      - Maintain vendor escalation history
      - Review vendor contacts quarterly
  - id: EP-MED-002
    signal: Escalation timing not optimized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same escalation delay for all severities
    - Escalation too slow for critical incidents
    - Escalation too aggressive for minor issues
    explanation: |
      Escalation timing should match incident severity. Critical incidents
      need rapid escalation (5-15 minutes) while lower severity incidents
      can wait longer before escalating.
    remediation: |
      - Define escalation timing per severity level
      - Configure severity-based escalation policies
      - Monitor escalation timing effectiveness
      - Adjust based on MTTR data
      - Document timing rationale
  low:
  - id: EP-LOW-001
    signal: Escalation metrics not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - Escalation frequency unknown
    - Escalation effectiveness not measured
    - No escalation failure tracking
    explanation: |
      Without metrics, organizations cannot optimize escalation policies.
      Tracking escalation frequency, timing, and outcomes enables
      continuous improvement.
    remediation: |
      - Implement escalation frequency tracking
      - Measure time-to-escalation by severity
      - Track escalation success/failure rate
      - Analyze escalation patterns monthly
      - Report escalation metrics to leadership
  positive:
  - id: EP-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive escalation paths with automatic triggers
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multi-tier escalation policies configured
    - Automatic escalation based on severity and timing
    - Regular escalation path testing
  - id: EP-POS-002
    signal: Cross-functional escalation procedures documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Technical, management, and vendor escalation paths
    - Cross-team escalation procedures
    - Contact information validated regularly
