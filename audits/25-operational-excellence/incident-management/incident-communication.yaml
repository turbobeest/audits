  what: |
    This audit examines incident communication practices including:
    - Internal communication channels and protocols
    - External stakeholder notification procedures
    - Status page management and updates
    - Communication templates and consistency
    - Cadence and timing of updates
    - Communication role assignment
    - Multi-channel coordination
    - Post-incident communication
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective incident communication maintains trust and reduces confusion:
    - Customers deserve timely, accurate information during outages
    - Internal teams need clear coordination to avoid duplicated effort
    - Poor communication extends perceived incident duration
    - Inconsistent messaging damages credibility

    The PagerDuty Incident Response guide emphasizes that communication
    is as important as technical resolution. Organizations with mature
    communication practices maintain customer trust even during significant
    outages by providing transparency and regular updates.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly operational reviews
  - After incidents with communication issues
  - Before major product launches
  - During customer trust reviews
  - When communication tools change

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ICOM-CRIT-001
    signal: No external incident communication process
    evidence_indicators:
    - No status page exists
    - Customers learn of outages through social media
    - No external communication templates
    explanation: |
      Customers affected by outages need timely, accurate information.
      Without proactive communication, customers perceive incidents as
      worse than they are, support load increases, and trust erodes.
      A status page and notification system are essential.
    remediation: |
      - Implement public status page (Statuspage, Cachet, etc.)
      - Create incident communication templates
      - Define update cadence by severity
      - Train team on external communication
      - Configure automated notifications
  - id: ICOM-CRIT-002
    signal: No dedicated incident communication channel
    evidence_indicators:
    - Incident coordination in general channels
    - Conversations scattered across multiple channels
    - No central incident discussion location
    explanation: |
      Without dedicated incident channels, critical information gets lost,
      responders are interrupted, and coordination suffers. PagerDuty
      recommends creating a dedicated channel for each incident.
    remediation: |
      - Create dedicated incident channel automatically
      - Establish channel naming convention
      - Configure automatic channel creation
      - Archive channels post-incident
      - Link channels to incident records
  high:
  - id: ICOM-HIGH-001
    signal: No Communication Lead role defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - Incident Commander handles all communication
    - Communication responsibilities unclear
    - Updates inconsistent during incidents
    explanation: |
      The Communication Lead role separates stakeholder communication from
      technical response. This allows the Incident Commander to focus on
      resolution while ensuring stakeholders receive regular updates.
    remediation: |
      - Define Communication Lead role
      - Document responsibilities
      - Train designated personnel
      - Include in incident role rotation
      - Create Communication Lead checklist
  - id: ICOM-HIGH-002
    signal: No communication templates exist
    evidence_indicators:
    - Updates written from scratch each time
    - Inconsistent message format
    - Critical information missing from updates
    explanation: |
      Templates ensure consistent, complete communication during high-stress
      incidents. Without templates, responders may forget key information
      or spend time crafting messages instead of resolving issues.
    remediation: |
      - Create templates for each incident stage
      - Include impact, status, ETA, and next update time
      - Template both internal and external communications
      - Review and update templates quarterly
      - Train team on template usage
  - id: ICOM-HIGH-003
    signal: Update cadence not defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long gaps between updates
    - No update frequency standards
    - Stakeholders complain about lack of information
    explanation: |
      Regular updates maintain trust even when there's no new information.
      Silence during incidents creates anxiety and prompts inquiry floods.
      Define update cadence based on severity (e.g., SEV1: every 15 min).
    remediation: |
      - Define update cadence per severity level
      - Set update reminders during incidents
      - Include "no change" updates if needed
      - Communicate next update time in each message
      - Monitor cadence adherence
  medium:
  - id: ICOM-MED-001
    signal: Status page updates not automated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Manual status page updates only
    - Status page lags behind actual status
    - No integration with monitoring
    explanation: |
      Manual status page updates are often delayed or forgotten during
      busy incidents. Automation ensures timely updates and reduces
      communication burden on responders.
    remediation: |
      - Integrate monitoring with status page
      - Configure automatic incident creation
      - Automate component status updates
      - Allow manual override when needed
      - Monitor automation reliability
  - id: ICOM-MED-002
    signal: No internal stakeholder notification
    evidence_indicators:
    - Support team unaware of incidents
    - Sales discovers outages from customers
    - Leadership not notified appropriately
    explanation: |
      Internal stakeholders (support, sales, leadership) need incident
      awareness to serve customers and make decisions. Separate internal
      notification from customer-facing communication.
    remediation: |
      - Define internal stakeholder groups
      - Create internal notification channels
      - Configure automatic internal alerts
      - Include business impact context
      - Establish leadership notification criteria
  low:
  - id: ICOM-LOW-001
    signal: Post-incident communication incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - No resolution notification sent
    - Root cause not communicated externally
    - Missing final update to stakeholders
    explanation: |
      Post-incident communication closes the loop with stakeholders.
      Resolution notification and root cause summary demonstrate
      accountability and commitment to improvement.
    remediation: |
      - Create resolution announcement template
      - Define root cause disclosure policy
      - Include improvement commitments
      - Send within 24 hours of resolution
      - Archive communication with incident
  positive:
  - id: ICOM-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive communication process with automation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dedicated incident channels auto-created
    - Status page integrated with monitoring
    - Templates for all incident phases
  - id: ICOM-POS-002
    signal: Communication Lead role effectively implemented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dedicated communication ownership
    - Regular stakeholder updates
    - Consistent message quality
