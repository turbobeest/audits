description:
  what: |
    Evaluates how effectively observability enables cross-team collaboration
    and visibility. Examines shared dashboards, standardized naming conventions,
    service dependency visibility, cross-team trace correlation, and the ability
    for any team to understand other teams' services during incidents.
  why_it_matters: |
    Modern distributed systems span team boundaries. During incidents, responders
    often need to investigate services owned by other teams. Without cross-team
    observability standards, teams create silos of visibility, making end-to-end
    debugging difficult and extending incident resolution times.
  when_to_run:
  - During incident retrospectives involving multiple teams
  - When establishing observability standards
  - After organizational restructuring
  - When onboarding complexity is high
  - Quarterly observability maturity reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CROSS-CRIT-001
    signal: No cross-service trace correlation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Traces stop at service boundaries
    - No context propagation implemented
    - Unable to follow requests end-to-end
    explanation: |
      Without cross-service trace correlation, debugging distributed
      transactions requires manual log correlation across multiple
      systems, dramatically increasing incident resolution time.
    remediation: Implement W3C Trace Context propagation across all services
  high:
  - id: CROSS-HIGH-001
    signal: Teams cannot access other teams' observability data
    explanation: Siloed dashboards prevent cross-team investigation
    remediation: Implement shared dashboard organization with clear ownership labels
  - id: CROSS-HIGH-002
    signal: No standard naming conventions for observability artifacts
    explanation: Inconsistent naming makes discovery impossible
    remediation: Establish and enforce organization-wide naming standards
  - id: CROSS-HIGH-003
    signal: Service ownership not visible in observability tools
    explanation: Responders cannot identify who to escalate to
    remediation: Add ownership labels to all metrics, dashboards, and alerts
  medium:
  - id: CROSS-MED-001
    signal: No service dependency visualization
    remediation: Implement service dependency mapping from traces or mesh
  - id: CROSS-MED-002
    signal: Inconsistent labeling across teams
    remediation: Define standard label taxonomy; implement validation
  - id: CROSS-MED-003
