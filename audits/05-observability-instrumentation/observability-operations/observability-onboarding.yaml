description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the effectiveness of observability onboarding for new engineers
    and new services. Examines documentation quality, self-service capabilities,
    training materials, templates, and the time required for new team members
    to become productive with observability tooling.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor observability onboarding leads to inconsistent instrumentation, repeated
    mistakes, and extended time-to-productivity. When engineers struggle to use
    observability tools effectively, they either avoid them or create suboptimal
    implementations. Good onboarding scales observability expertise across the
    organization and ensures consistent practices.
  when_to_run:
  - When new engineer feedback indicates onboarding friction
  - After major observability platform changes
  - During platform maturity assessments
  - When scaling engineering organization
  - Quarterly developer experience reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ONBOARD-CRIT-001
    signal: No observability onboarding documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No getting started guides
    - Tribal knowledge only
    - New engineers completely lost
    explanation: |
      Without documentation, every new engineer must learn through
      trial and error or by interrupting experienced team members.
      This creates inconsistency and slows organizational scaling.
    remediation: Create comprehensive observability onboarding documentation
  high:
  - id: ONBOARD-HIGH-001
    signal: New services lack observability by default
    explanation: Service templates don't include instrumentation
    remediation: Add observability to service templates and scaffolding
  - id: ONBOARD-HIGH-002
    signal: Observability not included in standard new engineer onboarding
    explanation: Observability skills are not systematically developed
