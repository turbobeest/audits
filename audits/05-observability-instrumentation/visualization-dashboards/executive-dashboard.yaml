  what: |
    Assesses executive dashboards for effectiveness in communicating
    system health, business KPIs, and operational status to leadership.
    Evaluates whether dashboards provide appropriate abstraction,
    business context, and actionable insights without technical
    complexity that obscures key information.
  why_it_matters: |
    Inadequate executive dashboards cause:
    - Leadership lacking visibility into system health
    - Misalignment between technical and business priorities
    - Delayed escalation of business-impacting issues
    - Difficulty justifying infrastructure investments
    - Inability to track progress against business goals
    - Poor communication during incidents with stakeholders
  when_to_run:
  - During quarterly business reviews
  - When creating new executive reporting
  - After organizational changes affecting leadership
  - During budget planning cycles

signals:
  critical:
  - id: EXEC-CRIT-001
    signal: No business impact metrics visible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dashboard shows only technical metrics
    - No revenue, user, or customer impact visibility
    explanation: |
      Executives need to understand business impact, not technical
      details. Without business metrics, they cannot make informed
      decisions or prioritize appropriately.
    remediation: |
      Add business KPI panels showing:
      - Revenue/transaction metrics
      - User/customer impact
      - SLA compliance
      - Business function availability
  - id: EXEC-CRIT-002
    signal: SLA compliance not visible
    evidence_indicators:
    - No SLA tracking panels
    - Customer commitments not represented
    explanation: |
      SLA compliance has direct business and contractual implications.
      Leadership needs visibility to manage customer relationships
      and risk.
    remediation: |
      Add SLA compliance panels showing current status,
      trend, and any violations.
  high:
  - id: EXEC-HIGH-001
    signal: Dashboard too technical for audience
    explanation: |
      Technical jargon and low-level metrics alienate executive
      audience and obscure actionable information.
    remediation: |
      Translate technical metrics to business terms.
      Show outcomes, not implementation details.
  - id: EXEC-HIGH-002
    signal: No trend or historical context
    explanation: |
      Point-in-time metrics without trends make it impossible
      to assess direction and progress.
    remediation: |
      Add trend lines, week-over-week comparisons,
      and goal progress tracking.
  medium:
  - id: EXEC-MED-001
    signal: Dashboard cluttered with too many panels
    remediation: |
      Reduce to 8-12 key panels maximum.
      Use drill-down for details rather than showing everything.
  - id: EXEC-MED-002
    signal: Missing cost visibility
    remediation: |
      Add infrastructure cost metrics correlated with
      business activity.
  - id: EXEC-MED-003
    signal: No comparison to goals/targets
    remediation: |
      Add goal markers and progress indicators for
      key business metrics.
  low:
  - id: EXEC-LOW-001
    signal: Dashboard requires technical knowledge to interpret
    remediation: |
      Add contextual help or legends explaining what
      metrics mean in business terms.
  positive:
  - id: EXEC-POS-001
    signal: Business KPIs prominently displayed
  - id: EXEC-POS-002
    signal: Clear, non-technical presentation
  - id: EXEC-POS-003
    signal: Goal progress and trends visible
