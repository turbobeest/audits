  what: |
    This audit evaluates signal processing algorithm correctness
    to ensure implementations match specifications. It examines:
    - Algorithm implementation vs. specification
    - Test vector verification
    - Boundary condition handling
    - Reference implementation comparison
    - Mathematical correctness validation
    - Numerical stability assessment
  why_it_matters: |
    Algorithm correctness is fundamental to signal processing:
    - Incorrect algorithms produce invalid results
    - Subtle errors may not be obvious in output
    - Test vectors verify implementation matches standard
    - Reference comparison catches implementation errors
    - Mathematical correctness ensures theoretical validity

    Signal processing depends on correct algorithms; errors
    propagate through all subsequent analysis.
  when_to_run:
  - Algorithm implementation
  - Code review
  - System validation
  - Porting to new platform
  - After algorithm modifications

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ALG-CRIT-001
    signal: Algorithm produces incorrect results
    evidence_indicators:
    - Test vectors fail
    - Output differs from reference
    - Mathematical properties violated
    explanation: |
      Incorrect algorithm output invalidates all downstream
      processing. Even small errors may indicate fundamental
      implementation problems.
    remediation: |
      - Compare against reference implementation
      - Verify with standard test vectors
      - Check mathematical properties
      - Review algorithm step by step
    cwe: CWE-682
  - id: ALG-CRIT-002
    signal: Algorithm specification not followed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Implementation differs from standard
    - Non-standard modifications without justification
    - Specification requirements not met
    explanation: |
      Deviating from specification without justification may
      introduce errors or incompatibilities. Standards exist
      for interoperability and correctness.
    remediation: |
      - Review specification requirements
      - Align implementation with standard
      - Document any intentional deviations
      - Verify deviation doesn't affect correctness
  high:
  - id: ALG-HIGH-001
    signal: Boundary conditions not handled correctly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Edge cases produce errors
    - Start/end of data not handled
    - Zero or extreme inputs cause problems
    explanation: |
      Boundary conditions often reveal implementation errors.
      Algorithm must handle edge cases correctly to be
      robust in all conditions.
    remediation: |
      - Test with boundary inputs
      - Handle zero-length and minimum inputs
      - Test with maximum/minimum values
      - Document boundary behavior
  - id: ALG-HIGH-002
    signal: No reference implementation comparison
    evidence_indicators:
    - Implementation not verified against reference
    - Only informal testing performed
    - No golden output comparison
    explanation: |
      Reference comparison is essential for validating
      custom implementations. Without comparison, subtle
      errors may go undetected.
    remediation: |
      - Compare against validated reference
      - Use established library as reference
      - Verify with standard test vectors
      - Document comparison results
  medium:
  - id: ALG-MED-001
    signal: Test coverage insufficient
    evidence_indicators:
    - Few test cases
    - Only happy path tested
    - No edge case coverage
    explanation: |
      Limited testing may miss errors in untested paths.
      Comprehensive testing improves confidence in
      algorithm correctness.
    remediation: |
      - Expand test vector coverage
      - Include edge cases
      - Test error conditions
      - Use property-based testing
  low:
  - id: ALG-LOW-001
    signal: Algorithm documentation incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - No specification reference
    - Assumptions not documented
    - Limitations not noted
    explanation: |
      Undocumented algorithms are difficult to verify and
      maintain. Specification references and assumptions
      should be explicit.
    remediation: |
      - Reference source specification
      - Document assumptions
      - Note any limitations
      - Include in code documentation
  positive:
  - id: ALG-POS-001
    signal: Well-verified algorithm implementation
