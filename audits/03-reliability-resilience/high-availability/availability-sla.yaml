description:
  what: |
    Examines the definition, measurement, and enforcement of Service Level
    Agreements (SLAs) for system availability. Reviews SLA targets, how they
    align with business requirements, monitoring mechanisms that track
    availability, and processes for handling SLA breaches.
  why_it_matters: |
    Availability SLAs set customer expectations and contractual obligations.
    Poorly defined SLAs lead to misaligned expectations, while unmeasured
    SLAs become meaningless promises. SLA breaches can result in financial
    penalties, customer churn, and reputational damage. Understanding the
    gap between promised and actual availability is essential for capacity
    planning and reliability investments.
  when_to_run:
  - During initial production readiness review
  - When defining or revising customer contracts
  - After significant architecture changes
  - Following availability incidents

signals:
  critical:
  - id: HA-SLA-CRIT-001
    signal: No defined availability SLA
    evidence_indicators:
    - Missing SLA documentation
    - No availability targets in contracts
    - No monitoring for availability metrics
    explanation: |
      Without a defined SLA, there is no shared understanding of
      availability expectations between teams and customers.
    remediation: Define and document availability SLAs aligned with business requirements
  - id: HA-SLA-CRIT-002
    signal: Actual availability significantly below SLA target
    evidence_threshold: Availability < SLA target by more than 0.5%
    explanation: |
      Chronic SLA breaches indicate systemic reliability issues and
      expose the organization to contractual penalties.
    remediation: Conduct root cause analysis and implement reliability improvements
  high:
  - id: HA-SLA-HIGH-001
    signal: SLA not measurable with current monitoring
    explanation: SLAs that cannot be measured cannot be managed or improved
    remediation: Implement monitoring that directly measures SLA metrics
  - id: HA-SLA-HIGH-002
    signal: Error budget exhausted or near exhaustion
    explanation: Indicates the system is operating at its reliability limits
    remediation: Pause feature work and focus on reliability improvements
  medium:
  - id: HA-SLA-MED-001
    signal: SLA targets not aligned with dependency SLAs
    remediation: Review and align SLA targets with upstream/downstream dependencies
  - id: HA-SLA-MED-002
    signal: No SLA breach notification process
    remediation: Implement automated alerting for SLA threshold breaches
  low:
  - id: HA-SLA-LOW-001
    signal: SLA documentation not regularly reviewed
  positive:
  - id: HA-SLA-POS-001
    signal: Error budget policy in place with clear actions
  - id: HA-SLA-POS-002
    signal: Regular SLA review meetings with stakeholders
