description:
  what: |
    Evaluates disaster recovery runbooks for completeness, accuracy,
    and usability. Assesses whether runbooks cover all critical systems,
    include clear step-by-step procedures, define roles and responsibilities,
    and can be executed under stress during actual disasters.
  why_it_matters: |
    During disasters, teams operate under extreme stress with limited time.
    Incomplete or unclear runbooks lead to mistakes, extended recovery times,
    and potential data loss. Well-structured runbooks enable consistent,
    rapid recovery even when primary experts are unavailable.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly runbook review
  - After any DR test reveals gaps
  - When systems or procedures change
  - After personnel changes in DR teams

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DRR-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical systems have no DR runbook
    evidence_indicators:
    - System not covered by any runbook
    - Runbook mentions system but has no procedures
    explanation: |
      Missing runbooks force teams to improvise during disasters,
      increasing recovery time and error risk significantly.
    remediation: Create comprehensive DR runbooks for all critical systems
  - id: DRR-CRIT-002
    signal: Runbooks contain outdated or incorrect procedures
    evidence_indicators:
    - References to decommissioned systems
    - Commands that no longer work
    - Incorrect contact information
    explanation: |
      Outdated runbooks may cause teams to waste time on invalid
      procedures or make mistakes following incorrect instructions.
    remediation: Review and update all runbooks for accuracy
  high:
  - id: DRR-HIGH-001
    signal: Runbooks lack clear step-by-step procedures
    explanation: Vague instructions are difficult to follow under stress
    remediation: Rewrite procedures with explicit, numbered steps
  - id: DRR-HIGH-002
    signal: Roles and responsibilities not clearly defined
    explanation: Unclear ownership causes delays and confusion during incidents
    remediation: Define explicit roles and responsibilities in runbooks
  medium:
  - id: DRR-MED-001
    signal: Runbooks not accessible during infrastructure outages
    remediation: Ensure runbooks are available offline or in multiple locations
  - id: DRR-MED-002
    signal: No runbook validation through tabletop exercises
    remediation: Conduct regular tabletop exercises to validate procedures
  low:
  - id: DRR-LOW-001
    signal: Runbook formatting inconsistent across documents
  positive:
  - id: DRR-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive, tested runbooks for all critical systems
  - id: DRR-POS-002
    signal: Regular runbook reviews with documented change history
