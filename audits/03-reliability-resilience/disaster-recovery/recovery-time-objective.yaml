description:
  what: |
    Assesses Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) definitions across systems
    and services. Evaluates whether RTOs are documented, realistic,
    aligned with business requirements, and supported by actual
    recovery capabilities and infrastructure.
  why_it_matters: |
    RTO defines the maximum acceptable downtime for a system. Unrealistic
    or undefined RTOs create false expectations and may result in SLA
    violations, revenue loss, and customer impact during outages.
    RTOs must be achievable with current infrastructure and procedures.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual disaster recovery planning
  - After significant infrastructure changes
  - Following failed recovery attempts
  - During SLA negotiations

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RTO-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical systems have no defined RTO
    evidence_indicators:
    - RTO not documented in BCP
    - No recovery time requirements specified
    explanation: |
      Without defined RTOs, there is no target for recovery efforts
      and no way to assess whether recovery capabilities are adequate.
    remediation: Define RTOs for all critical systems based on business impact analysis
  - id: RTO-CRIT-002
    signal: Actual recovery time significantly exceeds defined RTO
    evidence_indicators:
    - Test recovery took 4x longer than RTO
    - Historical incidents exceeded RTO
    explanation: |
      RTOs that cannot be met provide false assurance. When disaster
      strikes, business expectations will not be met.
    remediation: Either improve recovery capabilities or adjust RTO to realistic levels
  high:
  - id: RTO-HIGH-001
    signal: RTO defined without validation through testing
    explanation: Untested RTOs are theoretical and may not be achievable
    remediation: Conduct recovery tests and validate RTO achievability
  - id: RTO-HIGH-002
    signal: Dependencies not considered in RTO calculations
    explanation: Upstream dependencies may extend total recovery time
    remediation: Map dependencies and include in RTO planning
  medium:
  - id: RTO-MED-001
    signal: RTO not aligned with SLA commitments
    remediation: Reconcile RTO definitions with contractual SLAs
  - id: RTO-MED-002
    signal: No tiered RTO based on disaster severity
    remediation: Define RTOs for different disaster scenarios
  low:
  - id: RTO-LOW-001
    signal: RTO documentation not regularly reviewed
  positive:
  - id: RTO-POS-001
    signal: RTOs defined, tested, and documented for all critical systems
  - id: RTO-POS-002
    signal: Recovery tests consistently meet or beat RTO targets
