description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the organization's backup strategy including backup types
    (full, incremental, differential), backup frequency, retention policies,
    storage locations, and encryption practices. Assesses coverage across
    all critical data stores, databases, configurations, and secrets.
  why_it_matters: |
    A comprehensive backup strategy is the foundation of disaster recovery.
    Without proper backups, organizations risk permanent data loss, extended
    downtime, and potential business failure. Incomplete strategies leave
    gaps that only become apparent during actual disasters when recovery
    options are limited.
  when_to_run:
  - Initial infrastructure setup
  - Quarterly backup strategy review
  - After adding new data stores or services
  - Following any data loss incident

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DR-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical databases or data stores have no backup configured
    evidence_indicators:
    - Production database without backup job
    - Data store missing from backup inventory
    - Backup disabled for critical system
    explanation: |
      Unprotected data stores represent complete data loss risk. In a
      disaster scenario, this data cannot be recovered, potentially
      causing permanent business impact.
    remediation: Immediately configure backups for all unprotected critical systems
  - id: DR-CRIT-002
    signal: Backups stored only in same region/zone as primary data
    evidence_indicators:
    - Backup destination in same availability zone
    - No cross-region replication configured
    explanation: |
      Co-located backups provide no protection against regional disasters,
      data center failures, or zone-wide outages.
    remediation: Implement cross-region backup replication for all critical data
  high:
  - id: DR-HIGH-001
    signal: Backup encryption not enabled
    explanation: Unencrypted backups expose sensitive data if storage is compromised
    remediation: Enable encryption at rest for all backup storage
  - id: DR-HIGH-002
    signal: No backup retention policy defined
    explanation: Without retention policies, backups may be prematurely deleted or accumulate indefinitely
    remediation: Define and implement retention policies aligned with compliance requirements
  medium:
  - id: DR-MED-001
    signal: Backup frequency does not match data criticality
    remediation: Adjust backup schedules based on data classification and RPO requirements
  - id: DR-MED-002
    signal: Backup monitoring and alerting not configured
    remediation: Implement alerts for backup job failures and missed schedules
  low:
  - id: DR-LOW-001
    signal: Backup documentation outdated or incomplete
  positive:
  - id: DR-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive backup strategy with documented coverage matrix
  - id: DR-POS-002
    signal: 3-2-1 backup rule implemented (3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite)
