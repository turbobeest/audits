description:
  what: |
    This audit researches and documents available alternatives for
    each vendor dependency. It evaluates the viability of open source
    and competing commercial options, providing a roadmap for potential
    migration scenarios.
  why_it_matters: |
    Knowing alternatives exist (and understanding their capabilities)
    provides strategic flexibility and negotiating leverage. Without
    viable alternatives, you have no exit strategy and limited bargaining
    power with vendors.
  when_to_run:
  - During vendor contract negotiations
  - When planning architecture changes
  - For strategic technology reviews
  - Before major vendor decisions

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEP-ALT-CRIT-001
    signal: No viable alternative exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - Vendor is only provider
    - Proprietary technology with no equivalent
    - Monopoly position
    explanation: |
      When no alternatives exist, you're completely dependent on
      a single vendor. This creates existential risk and eliminates
      negotiating leverage.
    remediation: Assess build-vs-buy; consider reducing dependency
  high:
  - id: DEP-ALT-HIGH-001
    signal: Alternatives exist but significant feature gap
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical features missing in alternatives
    - Would require feature compromise
    remediation: Document gaps; plan workarounds; negotiate with vendors
  - id: DEP-ALT-HIGH-002
    signal: Only alternatives are equally proprietary
    evidence_indicators:
    - No open source option
    - Would trade one lock-in for another
    remediation: Evaluate all options; consider building abstraction
  medium:
  - id: DEP-ALT-MED-001
    signal: Alternatives available but less mature
    evidence_indicators:
    - Smaller community
    - Fewer features but growing
    remediation: Monitor alternatives; plan for future evaluation
  - id: DEP-ALT-MED-002
    signal: Open source alternative with commercial support
    evidence_indicators:
    - OSS version available
    - Commercial support optional
    remediation: Good position; document migration path
  low:
  - id: DEP-ALT-LOW-001
    signal: Multiple strong alternatives available
    evidence_indicators:
    - Competitive market
    - Feature parity options
    remediation: Low risk; maintain awareness
  positive:
  - id: DEP-ALT-POS-001
    signal: Viable alternatives documented for all vendors
  - id: DEP-ALT-POS-002
    signal: Open source alternatives available
