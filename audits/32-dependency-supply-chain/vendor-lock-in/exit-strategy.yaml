description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates the existence and viability of exit strategies
    for critical vendor relationships. It assesses whether plans exist
    to exit vendor relationships if needed, and whether those plans
    are realistic and tested.
  why_it_matters: |
    An exit strategy provides insurance against vendor problems including
    price increases, service degradation, discontinuation, or acquisition.
    Without an exit strategy, you may be forced into unfavorable situations
    with no practical recourse.
  when_to_run:
  - Annually for critical vendors
  - Before major vendor commitments
  - After vendor incidents or changes
  - During business continuity planning

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEP-EXIT-CRIT-001
    signal: No exit strategy for critical vendor
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented exit plan
    - No migration tested
    - Vendor is critical to operations
    explanation: |
      Without an exit strategy for critical vendors, you have no
      recourse if the vendor relationship becomes untenable. This
      creates significant business risk.
    remediation: Develop and document exit strategy immediately
  - id: DEP-EXIT-CRIT-002
    signal: Exit would cause extended outage
    evidence_indicators:
    - Migration requires significant downtime
    - No ability to run parallel systems
    remediation: Develop incremental migration approach
  high:
  - id: DEP-EXIT-HIGH-001
    signal: Exit strategy exists but untested
    evidence_indicators:
    - Plan documented but never tried
    - No runbooks or automation
    remediation: Conduct exit drill; validate plan
  - id: DEP-EXIT-HIGH-002
    signal: Data export capability unverified
    evidence_indicators:
    - Export theoretically possible
    - Never actually exported data
    remediation: Test data export; verify completeness
  medium:
  - id: DEP-EXIT-MED-001
    signal: Exit timeline exceeds acceptable limits
    evidence_indicators:
    - Exit would take months
    - May not meet RTO requirements
    remediation: Work to reduce exit time; add abstraction
  - id: DEP-EXIT-MED-002
    signal: Exit requires skills team doesn't have
    evidence_indicators:
    - Alternative uses different technology
    - Training needed for exit
    remediation: Plan training; document skill gaps
  low:
  - id: DEP-EXIT-LOW-001
    signal: Exit strategy documented but not recently updated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Plan more than a year old
    - May be out of date
    remediation: Review and update exit plan
  positive:
  - id: DEP-EXIT-POS-001
    signal: Tested exit strategy exists
