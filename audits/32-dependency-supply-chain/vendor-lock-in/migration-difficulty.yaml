description:
  what: |
    This audit assesses how difficult it would be to migrate away from
    current vendor dependencies to alternatives. It evaluates code
    coupling, data migration requirements, API compatibility, and
    overall effort required for migration.
  why_it_matters: |
    Understanding migration difficulty informs strategic decisions
    about vendor relationships. High migration difficulty means less
    negotiating power and higher risk. Knowing migration costs helps
    with build-vs-buy and vendor selection decisions.
  when_to_run:
  - Before vendor contract renewals
  - When evaluating alternatives
  - During cost optimization
  - For M&A due diligence

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEP-MIG-CRIT-001
    signal: Migration would require complete rewrite
    evidence_indicators:
    - Vendor APIs throughout codebase
    - No abstraction layer
    - 6+ month migration estimate
    explanation: |
      When migration effectively requires rewriting the application,
      you're severely locked in. This limits options and creates
      significant business risk.
    remediation: Prioritize abstraction layer development
  high:
  - id: DEP-MIG-HIGH-001
    signal: Significant data migration required
    evidence_indicators:
    - Large data volumes in proprietary format
    - Complex data transformation needed
    - Potential data loss risk
    remediation: Develop data migration strategy; test exports
  - id: DEP-MIG-HIGH-002
    signal: Critical features tied to vendor-specific APIs
    evidence_indicators:
    - Key functionality uses unique vendor features
    - No equivalent in alternatives
    remediation: Identify feature alternatives; plan workarounds
  medium:
  - id: DEP-MIG-MED-001
    signal: Moderate refactoring needed for migration
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some vendor coupling
    - 2-4 week migration estimate
    remediation: Plan migration; consider incremental approach
  - id: DEP-MIG-MED-002
    signal: Team lacks experience with alternatives
    evidence_indicators:
    - Training needed for new platform
    - Learning curve adds to migration
    remediation: Factor training into migration plans
  low:
  - id: DEP-MIG-LOW-001
    signal: Migration mostly configuration changes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Good abstraction already exists
    - Standard protocols used
    remediation: Low risk; maintain abstraction
  positive:
  - id: DEP-MIG-POS-001
    signal: Migration path clear and low effort
  - id: DEP-MIG-POS-002
    signal: Regular migration tests performed
