description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the quality and completeness of architecture documentation
    including system diagrams, component descriptions, data flow documentation,
    and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Assesses whether documentation
    enables understanding of system structure and design rationale.
  why_it_matters: |
    Architecture documentation is essential for understanding how systems
    fit together and why they were designed that way. Without it, developers
    make changes without understanding impact, repeat past mistakes, or
    create inconsistent designs.
  when_to_run:
  - After major architectural changes
  - Before system redesigns
  - When onboarding reveals confusion
  - Annually for maintenance

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ARCH-CRIT-001
    signal: No architecture documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No system diagrams
    - No component descriptions
    - Architecture is tribal knowledge
    explanation: |
      Without architecture documentation, system understanding
      is lost when team members leave.
    remediation: |
      Create C4 model diagrams starting with context and
      container levels. Document key components.
  - id: ARCH-CRIT-002
    signal: Architecture diagrams severely outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Diagrams show removed components
    - Missing recent additions
    - Incorrect relationships
    explanation: |
      Outdated diagrams mislead developers and lead to
      incorrect assumptions.
    remediation: |
      Update diagrams to reflect current state. Use
      diagrams-as-code for maintainability.
  high:
  - id: ARCH-HIGH-001
    signal: No Architecture Decision Records
    remediation: |
      Start capturing decisions as ADRs. Backfill
      significant past decisions.
  - id: ARCH-HIGH-002
    signal: Data flow undocumented
    remediation: |
      Create data flow diagrams showing how data moves
      through the system.
  - id: ARCH-HIGH-003
    signal: Integration points undocumented
    remediation: |
      Document all external integrations with contracts
      and failure modes.
  medium:
  - id: ARCH-MED-001
    signal: Diagrams not version controlled
    remediation: |
      Use diagrams-as-code (Mermaid, PlantUML) and
      version control with code.
  - id: ARCH-MED-002
    signal: Only one level of architecture detail
    remediation: |
      Create multiple levels following C4 model:
      context, container, component.
  - id: ARCH-MED-003
    signal: No deployment architecture
    remediation: |
      Document deployment topology and infrastructure.
  low:
  - id: ARCH-LOW-001
    signal: Architecture docs not linked from README
    remediation: |
      Add architecture documentation links to main README.
  - id: ARCH-LOW-002
    signal: No architecture review process
    remediation: |
      Establish process for reviewing and updating
      architecture documentation.
