description:
  what: |
    Evaluates how up-to-date documentation is relative to the code it
    describes. Analyzes documentation modification dates, identifies stale
    content, and assesses processes for keeping documentation current.
    Compares documentation changes against code changes.
  why_it_matters: |
    Stale documentation is often worse than no documentation, providing
    false confidence and incorrect guidance. Keeping documentation fresh
    ensures it remains a reliable resource. Measuring freshness helps
    prioritize documentation maintenance.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly documentation review
  - When documentation trust is low
  - After major system changes
  - Before onboarding waves

    questions:
    - Have you found outdated documentation?
    - How do you know when docs need updating?
    - Is there a process for keeping docs current?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FRESH-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical documentation over 1 year old
    evidence_indicators:
    - Setup guides unchanged for years
    - API docs with old versions
    - Architecture docs show old systems
    explanation: |
      Very old documentation in active areas is almost
      certainly outdated and potentially harmful.
    remediation: |
      Prioritize review of oldest critical documentation.
      Mark or remove clearly outdated content.
  - id: FRESH-CRIT-002
    signal: Code changed significantly but docs unchanged
    evidence_indicators:
    - Major refactors without doc updates
    - New features undocumented
    - Removed features still documented
    explanation: |
      Documentation drift from code makes docs unreliable
      and erodes trust.
    remediation: |
      Require documentation updates as part of code changes.
      Review docs as part of code review.
  high:
  - id: FRESH-HIGH-001
    signal: No 'last updated' dates on documentation
    remediation: |
      Add last verified/updated dates to documentation.
      Automate date updating where possible.
  - id: FRESH-HIGH-002
    signal: Documentation review not part of PR process
    remediation: |
      Add documentation impact to PR checklist.
      Review affected docs during code review.
  medium:
  - id: FRESH-MED-001
    signal: No documentation ownership
    remediation: |
      Assign documentation owners responsible for
      keeping sections current.
  - id: FRESH-MED-002
    signal: No regular documentation review cadence
    remediation: |
      Establish quarterly documentation review process.
  - id: FRESH-MED-003
    signal: Documentation freshness not tracked
    remediation: |
      Implement age tracking for documentation pages.
  low:
  - id: FRESH-LOW-001
    signal: No automated freshness alerts
    remediation: |
      Set up alerts for documentation not updated
      within threshold period.
  - id: FRESH-LOW-002
    signal: Stale documentation not marked
    remediation: |
      Add banners to potentially outdated content.
