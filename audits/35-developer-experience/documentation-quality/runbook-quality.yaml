description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the quality and completeness of operational runbooks including
    incident response procedures, deployment guides, troubleshooting guides,
    and maintenance procedures. Assesses whether runbooks enable effective
    operations under pressure.
  why_it_matters: |
    Runbooks are critical during incidents when stress is high and clear
    guidance is essential. Poor runbooks lead to longer incidents, missed
    steps, and repeated mistakes. Good runbooks enable consistent,
    effective operational response.
  when_to_run:
  - After incidents reveal gaps
  - Before on-call rotations
  - When new services launch
  - Quarterly operations review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RUNBOOK-CRIT-001
    signal: No runbooks exist for critical services
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented procedures
    - Incident response is improvised
    - Knowledge in individuals' heads
    explanation: |
      Without runbooks, incident response depends on
      whoever is available and their memory.
    remediation: |
      Create runbooks for all critical services covering
      common failure modes and recovery procedures.
  - id: RUNBOOK-CRIT-002
    signal: Runbooks contain incorrect procedures
    evidence_indicators:
    - Commands that fail
    - Outdated system names
    - Wrong escalation contacts
    explanation: |
      Incorrect runbooks during incidents cause delays
      and can worsen the situation.
    remediation: |
      Review and test all runbooks. Establish update
      process after system changes.
  high:
  - id: RUNBOOK-HIGH-001
    signal: Runbooks lack troubleshooting steps
    remediation: |
      Add diagnostic steps to identify root cause
      before applying fixes.
  - id: RUNBOOK-HIGH-002
    signal: No escalation procedures documented
    remediation: |
      Document when and how to escalate, with
      current contact information.
  - id: RUNBOOK-HIGH-003
    signal: Runbooks not updated after incidents
    remediation: |
      Establish post-incident review that includes
      runbook updates.
  medium:
  - id: RUNBOOK-MED-001
    signal: Runbooks hard to find during incidents
    remediation: |
      Organize runbooks with clear naming and
      searchable index.
  - id: RUNBOOK-MED-002
    signal: Runbooks not linked from alerts
    remediation: |
      Link relevant runbooks from alert definitions.
  - id: RUNBOOK-MED-003
    signal: No runbook review schedule
    remediation: |
      Establish regular runbook review cadence.
  low:
  - id: RUNBOOK-LOW-001
    signal: Runbook formatting inconsistent
    remediation: |
      Create runbook template and standardize format.
  - id: RUNBOOK-LOW-002
    signal: Runbooks not version controlled
    remediation: |
      Store runbooks in version control for history
      and collaboration.
