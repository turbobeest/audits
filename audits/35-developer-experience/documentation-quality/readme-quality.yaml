description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the quality and completeness of README files in the project,
    including the root README and package-level READMEs. Assesses whether
    READMEs provide essential information for understanding, using, and
    contributing to the project.
  why_it_matters: |
    The README is often the first documentation a developer encounters.
    A good README enables quick understanding and productive use. A poor
    README creates friction for new contributors and users, wastes time
    with unanswered questions, and can deter adoption.
  when_to_run:
  - Before open-sourcing a project
  - When onboarding difficulties arise
  - After major project changes
  - Quarterly documentation review
