description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the developer experience with issue tracking systems including
    ticket creation, search, filtering, workflow, and integration with
    development tools. Assesses whether issue tracking supports efficient
    work planning and execution.
  why_it_matters: |
    Issue tracking is central to development workflow. Poor issue tracking
    creates friction in planning, causes lost work, and makes progress
    invisible. Good issue tracking enables efficient work management,
    clear priorities, and historical context.
  when_to_run:
  - When work tracking complaints arise
  - Before tool migrations
  - When planning process changes
  - Quarterly DX review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ISSUE-CRIT-001
    signal: Issue tracker unusably slow
    evidence_indicators:
    - Page loads take seconds
    - Search times out
    - Developers avoid using it
    explanation: |
      Slow issue tracking disrupts workflow and causes
      developers to work around the system.
    remediation: |
      Optimize or migrate to faster issue tracking.
      Consider Linear or GitHub Issues.
  - id: ISSUE-CRIT-002
    signal: Cannot find issues easily
    evidence_indicators:
    - Search doesn't find known issues
    - Filtering limited or broken
    - Duplicate issues created
    explanation: |
      Poor discoverability leads to duplicate work
      and lost context.
    remediation: |
      Configure search and filtering properly.
      Establish labeling and organization conventions.
  high:
  - id: ISSUE-HIGH-001
    signal: No issue templates
    remediation: |
      Create issue templates for common types
      (bug, feature, task) with required fields.
  - id: ISSUE-HIGH-002
    signal: Workflow doesn't match process
    remediation: |
      Align issue states and workflow with actual
      development process.
  - id: ISSUE-HIGH-003
    signal: No integration with PR/commits
    remediation: |
      Configure PR/commit linking to issues for
      automatic status updates.
  medium:
  - id: ISSUE-MED-001
    signal: Issue hygiene poor
    remediation: |
      Establish regular grooming to close stale
      issues and update priorities.
  - id: ISSUE-MED-002
    signal: Labels/tags inconsistent
    remediation: |
      Define and document standard labels with
      clear purposes.
  - id: ISSUE-MED-003
    signal: No CLI access to issue tracker
    remediation: |
      Enable CLI tools for developers who prefer
      terminal workflows.
  low:
  - id: ISSUE-LOW-001
    signal: Issue tracker not customized
    remediation: |
      Customize fields and views for team needs.
  - id: ISSUE-LOW-002
    signal: No keyboard shortcuts
    remediation: |
      Use tools with shortcuts or create custom
      workflows for efficiency.
