description:
  what: |
    Evaluates tools and practices for sharing code snippets, examples,
    and solutions among team members. Assesses availability of snippet
    sharing, internal code examples, knowledge bases, and mechanisms
    for capturing and reusing code patterns.
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective code sharing prevents reinvention, spreads best practices,
    and accelerates problem solving. Without good sharing tools, solutions
    get lost in chat history or recreated repeatedly. Good sharing tools
    create a growing knowledge base of reusable solutions.
  when_to_run:
  - When duplication is common
  - When knowledge silos form
  - After team structure changes
  - Quarterly DX review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SHARE-CRIT-001
    signal: No mechanism for sharing code solutions
    evidence_indicators:
    - Code shared only in chat
    - No searchable snippet repository
    - Solutions lost after conversations
    explanation: |
      Without sharing mechanisms, valuable solutions disappear
      and problems get solved repeatedly.
    remediation: |
      Establish code sharing platform using GitHub Gists,
      internal wiki, or dedicated tool.
  - id: SHARE-CRIT-002
    signal: Shared code is insecure or incorrect
    evidence_indicators:
    - Security anti-patterns shared
    - Outdated solutions propagate
    - No review of shared content
    explanation: |
      Unreviewed shared code can spread bad practices
      across the organization.
    remediation: |
      Implement review process for shared code.
      Add disclaimers and version information.
  high:
  - id: SHARE-HIGH-001
    signal: Shared code not searchable
    remediation: |
      Ensure code sharing tool has search capability.
      Tag and categorize shared content.
  - id: SHARE-HIGH-002
    signal: No example repository or patterns library
    remediation: |
      Create curated examples repository with working
      code for common patterns.
  - id: SHARE-HIGH-003
    signal: Reusable code not packaged for reuse
    remediation: |
      Extract commonly needed code into internal
      packages or libraries.
  medium:
  - id: SHARE-MED-001
    signal: Code sharing siloed by team
    remediation: |
      Enable cross-team visibility of shared code.
      Create organization-wide sharing platform.
  - id: SHARE-MED-002
    signal: No mechanism for rating or feedback
    remediation: |
      Add ability to mark helpful content and
      provide feedback on shared code.
  - id: SHARE-MED-003
    signal: Sharing not integrated with workflow
    remediation: |
      Integrate sharing into Slack/Teams with
      code preview and search.
  low:
  - id: SHARE-LOW-001
    signal: No incentive for sharing
    remediation: |
      Recognize and celebrate valuable contributions
      to shared knowledge.
  - id: SHARE-LOW-002
    signal: Shared content not categorized
    remediation: |
      Implement tagging and categorization system.
