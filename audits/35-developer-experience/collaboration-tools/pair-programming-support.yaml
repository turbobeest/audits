description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the tooling and support for pair programming and mob
    programming, including real-time collaboration tools, remote pairing
    capabilities, and team practices around collaborative coding.
  why_it_matters: |
    Pair programming improves code quality, spreads knowledge, and
    accelerates onboarding. Without proper tooling, remote teams cannot
    pair effectively. Good pairing tools enable seamless collaboration
    regardless of location.
  when_to_run:
  - When transitioning to remote work
  - When onboarding takes too long
  - When knowledge silos form
  - Quarterly DX review

  interview_questions:
  - role: Developer
    questions:
    - Do you pair program with teammates?
    - What tools do you use for pairing?
    - How well does remote pairing work?
    - What would improve pairing experience?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PAIR-CRIT-001
    signal: No remote pairing capability
    evidence_indicators:
    - No real-time collaboration tools
    - Screen share only option
    - Remote team cannot pair
    explanation: |
      Remote teams without pairing tools lose collaboration
      benefits and struggle with knowledge transfer.
    remediation: |
      Deploy VS Code Live Share, Tuple, or similar
      for real-time code collaboration.
  - id: PAIR-CRIT-002
    signal: Pairing tools unusable due to latency
    evidence_indicators:
    - Significant typing lag
    - Frequent disconnections
    - Audio/video quality issues
    explanation: |
      Laggy pairing tools frustrate users and discourage
      collaborative work.
    remediation: |
      Test and optimize pairing tools. Consider tools
      designed for lower latency.
  high:
  - id: PAIR-HIGH-001
    signal: No audio/video integration with pairing
    remediation: |
      Use pairing tools with integrated audio or
      establish consistent A/V setup alongside.
  - id: PAIR-HIGH-002
    signal: Cannot share terminal and browser
    remediation: |
      Ensure pairing setup includes terminal and
      browser sharing for full collaboration.
  - id: PAIR-HIGH-003
    signal: Security concerns blocking pairing tools
    remediation: |
      Address security concerns with appropriate
      tool configurations and policies.
  medium:
  - id: PAIR-MED-001
    signal: Pairing not part of team practice
    remediation: |
      Encourage pairing through scheduling,
      guidelines, and cultural support.
  - id: PAIR-MED-002
    signal: Only one pairing tool available
    remediation: |
      Provide tool options for different IDE
      preferences (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.).
  - id: PAIR-MED-003
    signal: No mob programming support
    remediation: |
      Ensure tools scale to support multiple
      participants for mob programming.
  low:
  - id: PAIR-LOW-001
    signal: Pairing tools not documented
    remediation: |
      Document how to set up and use pairing tools.
  - id: PAIR-LOW-002
    signal: No pairing time tracking
    remediation: |
      Track pairing sessions for retrospective
      and practice improvement.
