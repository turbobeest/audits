description:
  what: |
    Evaluates capabilities for sharing development environments including
    cloud development environments, preview deployments, and shareable
    environment snapshots. Assesses how easily developers can share their
    work context for collaboration or debugging.
  why_it_matters: |
    Sharing environment context accelerates collaboration, debugging, and
    code review. "It works on my machine" problems disappear when environments
    are shareable. Preview deployments enable stakeholder feedback before merge.
  when_to_run:
  - When collaboration is difficult
  - When debugging requires reproduction
  - When adopting new dev tools
  - Quarterly DX review

signals:
  critical:

    signal: Cannot share development state
    evidence_indicators:
    - No cloud dev environments
    - No preview deployments
    - Must recreate issues locally
    explanation: |
      Inability to share context makes collaboration
      and debugging much harder.
    remediation: |
      Implement Codespaces/Gitpod for cloud environments
      or preview deployments for shareable state.
  high:
  - id: DEVSHARE-HIGH-001
    signal: No preview deployments for PRs
    remediation: |
      Configure preview deployments using Vercel,
      Netlify, or CI-based previews.
  - id: DEVSHARE-HIGH-002
    signal: Cloud dev environments not available
    remediation: |
      Configure Codespaces or Gitpod for instant
      shareable environments.
  - id: DEVSHARE-HIGH-003
    signal: Preview URLs not posted to PRs
    remediation: |
      Automate posting preview URLs as PR comments.
  medium:
  - id: DEVSHARE-MED-001
    signal: Preview environments slow to create
    remediation: |
      Optimize preview deployment pipeline for
      faster feedback.
  - id: DEVSHARE-MED-002
    signal: Cannot share database state
    remediation: |
      Implement database snapshots or seeding in
      preview environments.
  - id: DEVSHARE-MED-003
    signal: Preview environment configuration inconsistent
    remediation: |
      Align preview environment config with
      production for accurate testing.
  low:
  - id: DEVSHARE-LOW-001
    signal: Preview URLs not customizable
    remediation: |
      Configure meaningful preview URL patterns.
  - id: DEVSHARE-LOW-002
    signal: No authentication on previews
    remediation: |
      Add authentication to prevent unintended access.
