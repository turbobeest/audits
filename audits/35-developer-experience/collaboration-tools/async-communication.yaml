description:
  what: |
    Evaluates tools and practices for asynchronous technical communication
    including threaded discussions, RFC processes, technical decision
    documentation, and channels for non-urgent collaboration that
    accommodate different timezones and work styles.
  why_it_matters: |
    Async communication enables deep work, supports distributed teams,
    and creates searchable records. Over-reliance on sync communication
    fragments attention and excludes those not in the room. Good async
    practices balance responsiveness with focus time.
  when_to_run:
  - When distributed team grows
  - When meetings dominate calendars
  - When decisions lack documentation
  - Quarterly process review

  interview_questions:
  - role: Developer
    questions:
    - How do you communicate technical decisions?
    - Can you work across timezones effectively?
    - Is information discoverable later?
    - Do you have enough focus time?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ASYNC-CRIT-001
    signal: All decisions require real-time meetings
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot progress without meetings
    - No written decision process
    - Timezone disadvantage for some team members
    explanation: |
      Meeting-dependent communication excludes absent team
      members and leaves no decision record.
    remediation: |
      Implement RFC or written proposal process for
      technical decisions with async review.
  - id: ASYNC-CRIT-002
    signal: Technical discussions lost in chat
    evidence_indicators:
    - Important decisions in ephemeral chat
    - Cannot find past discussions
    - Context repeatedly re-explained
    explanation: |
      Lost discussions waste time and lead to
      repeated decisions without learning.
    remediation: |
      Move technical discussions to persistent,
      searchable platforms like GitHub Discussions.
  high:
  - id: ASYNC-HIGH-001
    signal: No RFC or proposal process
    remediation: |
      Implement RFC process for significant technical
      decisions with documented rationale.
  - id: ASYNC-HIGH-002
    signal: Expectation of immediate response
    remediation: |
      Establish response time norms that allow for
      async work and focus time.
  - id: ASYNC-HIGH-003
    signal: No threaded discussions
    remediation: |
      Use tools supporting threads to keep context
      together in async discussions.
  medium:
  - id: ASYNC-MED-001
    signal: Video communication only synchronous
    remediation: |
      Add async video tools like Loom for updates
      and explanations.
  - id: ASYNC-MED-002
    signal: No communication guidelines
    remediation: |
      Document when to use which channel and
      expected response times.
  - id: ASYNC-MED-003
    signal: Meeting notes not shared
    remediation: |
      Share meeting outcomes for async participants.
  low:
  - id: ASYNC-LOW-001
    signal: No status update mechanism
    remediation: |
      Implement async standup or status updates.
  - id: ASYNC-LOW-002
    signal: Too many communication channels
    remediation: |
      Consolidate and clarify channel purposes.
