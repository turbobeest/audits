description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the debugging capabilities available to developers including
    IDE debugger integration, source maps quality, logging infrastructure,
    error messages clarity, and debugging documentation. Assesses how
    effectively developers can diagnose and fix issues.
  why_it_matters: |
    Debugging consumes a significant portion of developer time. Poor
    debugging tools or missing source maps force developers to rely on
    console.log statements or guesswork, dramatically increasing time
    to resolution. Good debugging experience accelerates bug fixes and
    reduces developer frustration.
  when_to_run:
  - When developers report debugging difficulties
  - After build tool changes
  - When error reports are unclear
  - Quarterly experience review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEBUG-CRIT-001
    signal: No debugger integration available
    evidence_indicators:
    - No launch configurations
    - Breakpoints don't work
    - Debug mode not supported
    explanation: |
      Without debugger integration, developers cannot step through
      code, inspect variables, or efficiently diagnose issues.
    remediation: |
      Configure IDE debugger integration with appropriate launch
      configurations for all environments.
  - id: DEBUG-CRIT-002
    signal: Source maps completely broken or missing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Stack traces show minified code
    - Cannot debug transpiled code
    - Breakpoints hit wrong lines
    explanation: |
      Broken source maps make debugging transpiled or bundled
      code nearly impossible.
    remediation: |
      Configure proper source map generation in build tools.
      Use appropriate source map type for development.
  high:
  - id: DEBUG-HIGH-001
    signal: Error messages lack actionable context
    remediation: |
      Implement error boundaries with contextual information.
      Enhance error messages with stack traces and state.
  - id: DEBUG-HIGH-002
    signal: Cannot debug containerized applications
    remediation: |
      Configure remote debugging for containers with proper
      port mapping and source mounting.
  - id: DEBUG-HIGH-003
    signal: Debug configuration not documented
    remediation: |
      Document how to start the debugger for each development
      scenario and IDE.
  medium:
  - id: DEBUG-MED-001
    signal: Source maps slow or incomplete
    remediation: |
      Use appropriate source map devtool setting for
      development vs production balance.
  - id: DEBUG-MED-002
    signal: Logging infrastructure inconsistent
    remediation: |
      Standardize logging levels and format across the
      application for easier debugging.
  - id: DEBUG-MED-003
    signal: Cannot debug tests easily
    remediation: |
      Configure test runner with debugger integration.
  low:
  - id: DEBUG-LOW-001
    signal: No debug configuration for all IDEs
    remediation: |
      Provide debug configurations for common IDEs used
      by the team.
  - id: DEBUG-LOW-002
    signal: Debug shortcuts not documented
    remediation: |
      Document common debugging workflows and shortcuts.
  positive:
  - id: DEBUG-POS-001
    signal: Full IDE debugger integration with breakpoints
  - id: DEBUG-POS-002
    signal: Accurate source maps for all code
  - id: DEBUG-POS-003
    signal: Consistent structured logging
  - id: DEBUG-POS-004
