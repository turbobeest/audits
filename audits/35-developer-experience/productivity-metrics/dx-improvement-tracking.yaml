description:
  what: |
    Evaluates how DX improvements are tracked, prioritized, and measured
    over time. Assesses whether there is a systematic approach to improving
    developer experience with visible progress and accountability.
  why_it_matters: |
    Without tracking, DX improvements happen randomly or not at all.
    Systematic tracking ensures consistent investment in developer
    experience, measures impact of changes, and maintains momentum
    on improvements.
  when_to_run:
  - When starting DX program
  - When DX investment questioned
  - After major DX initiatives
  - Quarterly program review

    description: DX metrics over time
  access_requirements:
  - Project tracking access
  - Metrics dashboard access
  - Team interviews
discovery:
  file_patterns:
  - glob: '**/docs/dx/**'
    purpose: Find DX documentation
  - glob: '**/dx-roadmap.md'
    purpose: Find DX roadmap
  interview_questions:
  - role: Developer
    questions:
    - Have you seen DX improvements?
    - Do you know what DX work is planned?
    - Can you suggest DX improvements?
  - role: Engineering Manager
    questions:
    - How do you track DX improvements?
    - How do you measure DX impact?
    - What DX budget do you have?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DXTRACK-CRIT-001
    signal: No DX improvement tracking
    evidence_indicators:
    - No DX backlog
    - Ad-hoc improvements only
    - No DX ownership
    explanation: |
      Without tracking, DX improvements are random and
      progress cannot be demonstrated.
    remediation: |
      Create DX backlog with prioritization. Assign
      DX ownership and regular review.
  - id: DXTRACK-CRIT-002
    signal: No DX improvement for 6+ months
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same complaints persist
    - No visible DX changes
    - Developer frustration growing
    explanation: |
      Lack of improvement signals that DX is not
      a priority, damaging morale.
    remediation: |
      Commit to regular DX improvements. Start with
      quick wins to build momentum.
  high:
  - id: DXTRACK-HIGH-001
    signal: No DX metrics baseline
    remediation: |
      Establish baseline DX metrics to measure
      improvement against.
  - id: DXTRACK-HIGH-002
    signal: DX improvements not communicated
    remediation: |
      Announce and celebrate DX improvements to
      show investment and gather feedback.
  - id: DXTRACK-HIGH-003
    signal: No DX budget or allocation
    remediation: |
      Allocate explicit time/budget for DX work.
      Typical is 10-20% of platform effort.
  medium:
  - id: DXTRACK-MED-001
    signal: DX backlog not prioritized
    remediation: |
      Prioritize DX backlog based on impact
      and effort.
  - id: DXTRACK-MED-002
    signal: No DX roadmap
    remediation: |
      Create DX roadmap showing planned
      improvements and timeline.
  - id: DXTRACK-MED-003
    signal: Impact not measured
    remediation: |
      Define success metrics for DX initiatives
      and measure post-implementation.
  low:
  - id: DXTRACK-LOW-001
    signal: DX progress not visible
    remediation: |
      Create DX dashboard showing progress
      and impact.
  - id: DXTRACK-LOW-002
    signal: No DX retrospectives
    remediation: |
      Include DX discussion in retrospectives.
  positive:
  - id: DXTRACK-POS-001
    signal: Visible DX backlog and roadmap
  - id: DXTRACK-POS-002
    signal: Regular DX improvements shipped
