description:
  what: |
    Identifies and quantifies sources of developer friction including
    wait times, context switches, tooling issues, and process overhead.
    Maps the developer journey to find pain points that reduce productivity
    and satisfaction.
  why_it_matters: |
    Developer friction compounds throughout the day, significantly
    impacting productivity and morale. Small frictions add up to hours
    of lost productivity weekly. Identifying friction enables targeted
    improvements with measurable impact.
  when_to_run:
  - After DX survey results
  - When productivity concerns arise
  - Before platform investments
  - Quarterly for trending

  - Interview access
discovery:
  file_patterns:
  - glob: '**/docs/dx/**'
    purpose: Find DX documentation
  interview_questions:
  - role: Developer
    questions:
    - What wastes the most time in your day?
    - What tool or process is most frustrating?
    - Where do you wait most often?
    - What would you fix first?

    purpose: Manual friction tracking
  - tool: time-tracking
    purpose: Context switch analysis
signals:
  critical:
  - id: FRICTION-CRIT-001
    signal: Developers report significant daily friction
    evidence_indicators:
    - Common complaints about tooling
    - Frequent context switches
    - Long wait times
    explanation: |
      High friction drives away talent and reduces
      output significantly.
    remediation: |
      Prioritize addressing top friction sources.
      Implement systematic friction logging.
  - id: FRICTION-CRIT-002
    signal: Friction not measured or tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No friction logging
    - No DX surveys
    - Anecdotal feedback only
    explanation: |
      Without measurement, friction cannot be
      systematically addressed.
    remediation: |
      Implement friction logging and regular
      DX surveys to capture pain points.
  high:
  - id: FRICTION-HIGH-001
    signal: Build/test wait time exceeds 15 min/day
    remediation: |
      Optimize build times and parallelize tests.
      Target under 5 min daily wait time.
  - id: FRICTION-HIGH-002
    signal: More than 5 context switches per day
    remediation: |
      Reduce interruptions, batch similar work,
      and improve async communication.
  - id: FRICTION-HIGH-003
    signal: Tooling issues reported weekly
    remediation: |
      Address tooling reliability issues and
      establish support processes.
  medium:
  - id: FRICTION-MED-001
    signal: Friction feedback not acted upon
    remediation: |
      Create visible backlog of friction fixes.
      Celebrate friction eliminations.
  - id: FRICTION-MED-002
    signal: No friction improvement goals
    remediation: |
      Set targets for friction reduction and
      track progress.
  - id: FRICTION-MED-003
    signal: Friction varies significantly by team
    remediation: |
      Share best practices across teams.
      Standardize tooling and processes.
  low:
  - id: FRICTION-LOW-001
    signal: No friction visibility to leadership
    remediation: |
      Report friction metrics to engineering
      leadership for prioritization.
  - id: FRICTION-LOW-002
    signal: Friction not part of retros
    remediation: |
      Include friction discussion in team
      retrospectives.
