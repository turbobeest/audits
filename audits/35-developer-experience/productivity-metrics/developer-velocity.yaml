description:
  what: |
    Measures and analyzes developer velocity metrics including deployment
    frequency, lead time for changes, cycle time, and throughput. Uses
    DORA metrics as a framework for understanding engineering effectiveness
    and identifying improvement opportunities.
  why_it_matters: |
    Developer velocity directly impacts business outcomes. DORA research
    shows that elite performers deploy 208x more frequently than low
    performers. Understanding velocity metrics helps identify bottlenecks
    and measure improvement initiatives.
  when_to_run:
  - Monthly for continuous tracking
  - After process changes
  - Before team scaling
  - Quarterly executive reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: VELOCITY-CRIT-001
    signal: Deployment frequency less than monthly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deployments require extensive coordination
    - Batch releases with many changes
    - Long release cycles
    explanation: |
      Low deployment frequency indicates delivery bottlenecks
      and correlates with lower stability.
    remediation: |
      Implement continuous delivery practices. Break down
      work into smaller deployable units.
  - id: VELOCITY-CRIT-002
    signal: Lead time for changes exceeds one month
    evidence_indicators:
    - PRs wait weeks for review
    - Long QA cycles
    - Complex deployment processes
    explanation: |
      Long lead times delay value delivery and feedback,
      making course corrections difficult.
    remediation: |
      Analyze lead time components to identify bottlenecks.
      Implement flow efficiency improvements.
  high:
  - id: VELOCITY-HIGH-001
    signal: Deployment frequency weekly or less
    remediation: |
      Work toward daily deployments through automation
      and process improvements.
  - id: VELOCITY-HIGH-002
    signal: Lead time one to four weeks
    remediation: |
      Reduce PR cycle time, automate testing, and
      streamline deployment process.
  - id: VELOCITY-HIGH-003
    signal: Cycle time highly variable
    remediation: |
      Investigate variation sources. Standardize work
      sizing and process.
  medium:
  - id: VELOCITY-MED-001
    signal: Velocity not measured
    remediation: |
      Implement DORA metrics tracking through tooling
      or manual measurement.
  - id: VELOCITY-MED-002
    signal: Metrics not visible to team
    remediation: |
      Create dashboards showing velocity metrics
      for team visibility.
  - id: VELOCITY-MED-003
    signal: No velocity improvement goals
    remediation: |
      Set measurable velocity improvement targets
      aligned with business needs.
  low:
  - id: VELOCITY-LOW-001
    signal: Metrics not discussed in retrospectives
    remediation: |
      Include velocity metrics in retrospective
      discussions.
  - id: VELOCITY-LOW-002
    signal: No historical velocity data
    remediation: |
      Begin capturing baseline data for future
      comparison.
