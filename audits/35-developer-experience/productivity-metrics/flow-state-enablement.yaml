description:
  what: |
    Evaluates how well the development environment and culture support
    deep work and flow state, including interruption patterns, meeting
    load, notification policies, and focus time availability. Assesses
    whether developers can achieve sustained concentration.
  why_it_matters: |
    Flow state is when developers do their best work. Research shows it
    takes 15-23 minutes to reach flow state and any interruption resets
    the clock. Environments that protect focus time dramatically
    outperform those with constant interruptions.
  when_to_run:
  - When productivity feels low
  - When meetings dominate calendars
  - After team structure changes
  - Quarterly DX review

    questions:
    - How often can you work uninterrupted?
    - What typically breaks your concentration?
    - Do you have protected focus time?
    - How many meetings do you have daily?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FLOW-CRIT-001
    signal: No 2+ hour uninterrupted blocks available
    evidence_indicators:
    - Meetings scattered throughout day
    - Constant notifications expected
    - Always-on culture
    explanation: |
      Without extended focus blocks, developers cannot
      reach flow state for complex work.
    remediation: |
      Implement no-meeting days or meeting-free blocks.
      Establish focus time policies.
  - id: FLOW-CRIT-002
    signal: More than 4 hours of meetings daily average
    evidence_indicators:
    - Calendar dominated by meetings
    - Little time for individual work
    - After-hours coding common
    explanation: |
      Excessive meetings prevent the deep work that
      creates actual value.
    remediation: |
      Audit and reduce meeting load. Make meetings
      optional by default with async alternatives.
  high:
  - id: FLOW-HIGH-001
    signal: Expected to respond within minutes
    remediation: |
      Establish reasonable response time expectations.
      Use urgent channels only for true urgencies.
  - id: FLOW-HIGH-002
    signal: Notifications not managed
    remediation: |
      Implement notification management. Encourage
      DND/focus modes during deep work.
  - id: FLOW-HIGH-003
    signal: No async-first communication norms
    remediation: |
      Shift default to async communication.
      Reserve sync for discussions requiring it.
  medium:
  - id: FLOW-MED-001
    signal: Open office without quiet spaces
    remediation: |
      Provide quiet areas for focus work.
      Support remote work for deep work needs.
  - id: FLOW-MED-002
    signal: No focus time protection tools
    remediation: |
      Deploy tools like Clockwise or Reclaim to
      protect focus blocks automatically.
  - id: FLOW-MED-003
    signal: Context switching between projects
    remediation: |
      Minimize multi-project assignments.
      Batch similar work together.
  low:
  - id: FLOW-LOW-001
    signal: Focus time not tracked
    remediation: |
      Measure available focus time to improve it.
  - id: FLOW-LOW-002
    signal: No working agreements on focus time
    remediation: |
      Create team agreements about protecting focus.
  positive:

    signal: 4+ hours of focus time available daily
  - id: FLOW-POS-002
    signal: No-meeting days or blocks established
  - id: FLOW-POS-003
    signal: Async-first communication culture
  - id: FLOW-POS-004
