description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the implementation and effectiveness of developer experience
    surveys, including survey design, frequency, response rates, analysis
    methods, and how results drive improvements. Assesses whether surveys
    effectively capture developer sentiment and needs.
  why_it_matters: |
    Surveys are primary input for understanding developer experience at
    scale. Poor surveys waste developer time and miss issues. Well-designed
    surveys with high response rates provide actionable insights for
    improving DX systematically.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching new surveys
  - When response rates decline
  - When survey value questioned
  - Annually for survey review

    questions:
    - Do you complete DX surveys?
    - Do surveys ask the right questions?
    - Do you see actions from survey results?
    - What would improve the survey process?
  - role: Engineering Manager
    questions:
    - How do you use survey results?
    - What response rate do you achieve?
    - What changes have surveys driven?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SURVEY-CRIT-001
    signal: No DX surveys conducted
    evidence_indicators:
    - No systematic feedback collection
    - Ad-hoc feedback only
    - Developer sentiment unknown
    explanation: |
      Without surveys, DX improvements are based on
      assumptions rather than data.
    remediation: |
      Implement quarterly DX surveys using established
      frameworks like SPACE or DevEx Core 4.
  - id: SURVEY-CRIT-002
    signal: Survey results not acted upon
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same issues reported repeatedly
    - No visible changes from surveys
    - Developer cynicism about surveys
    explanation: |
      Ignored surveys waste time and breed cynicism,
      reducing future participation.
    remediation: |
      Create visible action plans from surveys.
      Communicate changes driven by feedback.
  high:
  - id: SURVEY-HIGH-001
    signal: Response rate below 50%
    remediation: |
      Make surveys shorter, more relevant, and
      show clear value to respondents.
  - id: SURVEY-HIGH-002
    signal: Survey questions outdated or irrelevant
    remediation: |
      Review and update questions regularly based
      on current concerns and context.
  - id: SURVEY-HIGH-003
    signal: Results not shared with team
    remediation: |
      Share survey results transparently with
      the team who provided feedback.
  medium:
  - id: SURVEY-MED-001
    signal: Survey frequency inappropriate
    remediation: |
      Balance frequency to capture trends without
      survey fatigue (quarterly is common).
  - id: SURVEY-MED-002
    signal: No trending analysis
    remediation: |
      Track responses over time to identify
      improving or declining areas.
  - id: SURVEY-MED-003
    signal: Free-form feedback not analyzed
    remediation: |
      Systematically review and categorize
      open-ended responses.
  low:
  - id: SURVEY-LOW-001
    signal: Survey length discourages completion
    remediation: |
      Keep surveys under 10 minutes. Use
      conditional logic to reduce questions.
  - id: SURVEY-LOW-002
    signal: Anonymous feedback not available
    remediation: |
      Offer anonymous option for sensitive
      feedback topics.
  positive:
  - id: SURVEY-POS-001
    signal: Regular DX surveys with high response rate
  - id: SURVEY-POS-002
    signal: Clear action plans from survey results
  - id: SURVEY-POS-003
    signal: Results shared and discussed openly
  - id: SURVEY-POS-004
