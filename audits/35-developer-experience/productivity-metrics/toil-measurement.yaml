description:
  what: |
    Identifies and quantifies toil - manual, repetitive, automatable work
    that scales with system size. Measures time spent on operational tasks
    that could be eliminated through automation or process improvement,
    following SRE principles.
  why_it_matters: |
    Toil consumes engineering capacity without providing lasting value.
    Google SRE targets keeping toil below 50% of time. High toil leads
    to burnout, technical debt accumulation, and reduced capacity for
    improvement work.
  when_to_run:
  - When engineers feel overwhelmed
  - Before automation investments
  - When operational load grows
  - Quarterly toil review

  interview_questions:
  - role: Developer
    questions:
    - What repetitive tasks do you do?
    - What would you automate first?
    - How much time goes to manual work?
    - What tasks scale linearly with users?
  - role: SRE/DevOps
    questions:
    - What operational tasks take most time?
    - What toil could be automated?
    - How do you track toil?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TOIL-CRIT-001
    signal: Toil exceeds 50% of engineering time
    evidence_indicators:
    - Constant firefighting
    - No time for improvements
    - Engineers doing repetitive manual work
    explanation: |
      Excessive toil crowds out valuable work and leads
      to burnout and attrition.
    remediation: |
      Aggressively automate or eliminate top toil sources.
      Set toil budget and track against it.
  - id: TOIL-CRIT-002
    signal: Toil growing with system/team size
    evidence_indicators:
    - Linear scaling of manual work
    - Adding people doesn't help
    - Operational load increases
    explanation: |
      Unaddressed scaling toil eventually overwhelms
      engineering capacity.
    remediation: |
      Prioritize automating toil that scales with
      system size or user count.
  high:
  - id: TOIL-HIGH-001
    signal: No toil tracking
    remediation: |
      Implement toil categorization and time tracking
      to make toil visible.
  - id: TOIL-HIGH-002
    signal: Manual deployments common
    remediation: |
      Automate deployment process to eliminate
      deployment toil.
  - id: TOIL-HIGH-003
    signal: Manual incident remediation
    remediation: |
      Automate common incident remediations.
      Create self-healing systems.
  medium:
  - id: TOIL-MED-001
    signal: No toil budget
    remediation: |
      Set explicit toil budget (e.g., max 30%)
      and track against it.
  - id: TOIL-MED-002
    signal: Toil reduction not prioritized
    remediation: |
      Allocate explicit time for toil elimination
      projects.
  - id: TOIL-MED-003
    signal: Same toil affecting multiple people
    remediation: |
      Prioritize automating toil with broad impact.
  low:
  - id: TOIL-LOW-001
    signal: No toil visibility to leadership
    remediation: |
      Report toil metrics to leadership for
      resource allocation.
  - id: TOIL-LOW-002
    signal: Automation debt not tracked
    remediation: |
      Maintain backlog of automation opportunities.
