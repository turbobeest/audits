description:
  what: |
    Evaluates how well the codebase integrates with common IDEs including
    VS Code, IntelliJ/WebStorm, and others. Assesses configuration presence,
    extension recommendations, workspace settings, and feature availability
    like IntelliSense, debugging, and refactoring tools.
  why_it_matters: |
    Good IDE integration dramatically accelerates development through features
    like autocomplete, go-to-definition, refactoring, and integrated debugging.
    Poor integration forces developers to work without these productivity
    multipliers or spend time configuring their environment.
  when_to_run:
  - When onboarding new developers
  - After adding new languages or frameworks
  - When developers report IDE issues
  - Quarterly DX review

  interview_questions:
  - role: Developer
    questions:
    - Which IDE do you use?
    - Does autocomplete work well?
    - Can you navigate to definitions easily?
    - What IDE features don't work as expected?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: IDE-CRIT-001
    signal: No IDE configuration in repository
    evidence_indicators:
    - No .vscode or .idea directories
    - No workspace settings
    - No extension recommendations
    explanation: |
      Without shared IDE configuration, each developer must
      configure their environment from scratch, leading to
      inconsistent setups.
    remediation: |
      Add VS Code workspace configuration including settings.json
      and extensions.json with recommended extensions.
  - id: IDE-CRIT-002
    signal: Language features completely broken
    evidence_indicators:
    - No autocomplete
    - Go-to-definition doesn't work
    - Errors not shown in editor
    explanation: |
      Broken language features force developers to work without
      IDE assistance, dramatically slowing development.
    remediation: |
      Fix language server configuration, ensure tsconfig/jsconfig
      is correct, and verify IDE extensions are recommended.
  high:
  - id: IDE-HIGH-001
    signal: IntelliSense slow or unreliable
    remediation: |
      Optimize tsconfig includes/excludes, consider project
      references for large codebases.
  - id: IDE-HIGH-002
    signal: Formatting conflicts between tools
    remediation: |
      Align Prettier, ESLint, and EditorConfig settings.
      Disable conflicting formatters.
  - id: IDE-HIGH-003
    signal: Debug configuration missing
    remediation: |
      Add launch.json configurations for common debug scenarios.
  medium:
  - id: IDE-MED-001
    signal: Extension recommendations not specified
    remediation: |
      Add extensions.json with recommended extensions
      for the project.
  - id: IDE-MED-002
    signal: No workspace settings for project conventions
    remediation: |
      Add settings.json with project-specific settings
      like tab size, format on save, etc.
  - id: IDE-MED-003
    signal: Only one IDE supported
    remediation: |
      Add configurations for multiple common IDEs
      used by team members.
  low:
  - id: IDE-LOW-001
    signal: No EditorConfig for basic consistency
    remediation: |
      Add .editorconfig for cross-IDE consistency on
      basic settings like indentation.
  - id: IDE-LOW-002
    signal: IDE configuration not documented
    remediation: |
      Document recommended IDE setup in README or
      contributing guide.
