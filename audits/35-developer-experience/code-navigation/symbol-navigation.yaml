description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the ability to navigate code using semantic symbols including
    go-to-definition, find references, find implementations, and symbol
    search. Assesses coverage across different file types, accuracy of
    navigation, and cross-project/cross-file navigation capabilities.
  why_it_matters: |
    Symbol navigation is essential for understanding code relationships
    and making changes safely. Without it, developers must manually trace
    through code, which is slow and error-prone. Good symbol navigation
    makes exploring and modifying code dramatically faster.
  when_to_run:
  - When adding new languages to project
  - When developers report navigation issues
  - After IDE or tooling changes
  - Quarterly DX review

  interview_questions:
  - role: Developer
    questions:
    - Can you jump to definitions easily?
    - Does 'find all references' work well?
    - What file types have poor navigation?
    - Can you navigate across packages/modules?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: NAV-CRIT-001
    signal: Go-to-definition completely broken
    evidence_indicators:
    - Jumps to wrong location
    - Cannot find definitions
    - Language server not running
    explanation: |
      Broken go-to-definition forces manual code tracing,
      dramatically slowing comprehension and modification.
    remediation: |
      Configure appropriate language server and ensure
      project configuration is correct.
  - id: NAV-CRIT-002
    signal: Find references returns incomplete results
    evidence_indicators:
    - Missing obvious references
    - Incorrect results
    - Only partial project indexed
    explanation: |
      Incomplete reference finding makes safe refactoring
      impossible and leads to missed updates.
    remediation: |
      Ensure full project is included in language server
      configuration. Check tsconfig/jsconfig includes.
  high:
  - id: NAV-HIGH-001
    signal: Navigation slow for large projects
    remediation: |
      Optimize language server configuration, use project
      references, or exclude unnecessary files.
  - id: NAV-HIGH-002
    signal: Cannot navigate to third-party code
    remediation: |
      Install type definitions for libraries. Configure
      language server to include node_modules types.
  - id: NAV-HIGH-003
    signal: Navigation broken for some file types
    remediation: |
      Install appropriate language servers for all
      file types used in the project.
  medium:
  - id: NAV-MED-001
    signal: Find implementations unavailable
    remediation: |
      Ensure language server supports find implementations.
      May require TypeScript/type information.
  - id: NAV-MED-002
    signal: Cannot navigate across project boundaries
    remediation: |
      Configure project references or use Sourcegraph
      for cross-project navigation.
  - id: NAV-MED-003
    signal: Symbol outline not available
    remediation: |
      Configure document symbol provider in language server.
  low:
  - id: NAV-LOW-001
    signal: Breadcrumb navigation missing
    remediation: |
      Enable breadcrumb feature in IDE for hierarchical
      navigation.
  - id: NAV-LOW-002
    signal: Call hierarchy unavailable
    remediation: |
      Use language server that supports call hierarchy
      for understanding code flow.
  positive:
  - id: NAV-POS-001
    signal: Instant go-to-definition across entire codebase
  - id: NAV-POS-002
    signal: Complete and accurate find references
  - id: NAV-POS-003
    signal: Navigation works across all file types
  - id: NAV-POS-004
    signal: Type hierarchy and call hierarchy available
