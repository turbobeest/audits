description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the structure and effectiveness of developer mentorship and
    buddy programs. Assesses how new developers are paired with experienced
    team members, the clarity of mentor responsibilities, support provided
    to mentors, and outcomes of mentorship relationships.
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective mentorship accelerates onboarding, transfers tacit knowledge
    that documentation cannot capture, and builds team relationships.
    Without structured mentorship, new developers may struggle silently
    or repeatedly interrupt senior developers with ad-hoc questions.
  when_to_run:
  - Before scaling the team
  - When onboarding issues arise
  - During annual program review
  - When mentor capacity is strained

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MENTOR-CRIT-001
    signal: No mentorship or buddy program exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - New developers figure things out alone
    - Ad-hoc help from whoever is available
    - Inconsistent support across new hires
    explanation: |
      Without structured mentorship, onboarding quality varies wildly
      and critical tacit knowledge may never transfer.
    remediation: |
      Establish a formal buddy program with assigned mentors,
      clear expectations, and time allocation.
  - id: MENTOR-CRIT-002
    signal: Mentors have no time allocated for mentorship
    evidence_indicators:
    - Mentorship happens only if sprint allows
    - Mentors feel overwhelmed by dual responsibilities
    - Mentees report difficulty getting mentor time
    explanation: |
      Mentorship without dedicated time competes with delivery
      work and typically loses.
    remediation: |
      Formally allocate mentor time in sprint planning,
      typically 10-20% of capacity.
  high:
  - id: MENTOR-HIGH-001
    signal: No mentor training or guidelines
    remediation: |
      Create mentor training program covering expectations,
      techniques, and common challenges.
  - id: MENTOR-HIGH-002
    signal: Mentor-mentee pairings arbitrary
    remediation: |
      Develop matching criteria considering skills, personality,
      and career interests.
  - id: MENTOR-HIGH-003
    signal: No mechanism to change mentor if pairing isn't working
    remediation: |
      Establish clear process for addressing mentorship issues
      or changing assignments.
  medium:
  - id: MENTOR-MED-001
    signal: Mentorship ends after first week
    remediation: |
      Extend mentorship period to cover full ramp-up,
      typically 30-90 days.
  - id: MENTOR-MED-002
    signal: No structured check-ins or milestones
    remediation: |
      Define onboarding milestones and regular check-in cadence.
  - id: MENTOR-MED-003
    signal: Mentorship not recognized in performance reviews
    remediation: |
      Include mentorship contributions in evaluation criteria.
  low:
  - id: MENTOR-LOW-001
    signal: No feedback collection from mentees
    remediation: |
      Implement post-onboarding surveys to improve program.
  - id: MENTOR-LOW-002
    signal: Mentorship documentation sparse
    remediation: |
      Document mentor responsibilities, resources, and expectations.
