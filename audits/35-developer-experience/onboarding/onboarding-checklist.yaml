description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the existence, completeness, and effectiveness of structured
    onboarding checklists for new developers. Assesses whether checklists
    cover all necessary areas, are tracked consistently, have clear owners,
    and are maintained as processes change.
  why_it_matters: |
    A comprehensive onboarding checklist ensures no critical steps are
    missed, provides visibility into onboarding progress, and creates
    consistency across new hires. Without checklists, onboarding quality
    depends entirely on the memory and availability of the onboarding
    coordinator.
  when_to_run:
  - Before onboarding new developers
  - After onboarding process changes
  - When onboarding issues arise
  - Quarterly for maintenance
