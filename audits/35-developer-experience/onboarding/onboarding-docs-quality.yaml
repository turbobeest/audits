description:
  what: |
    Assesses the quality, completeness, and accuracy of documentation
    specifically designed for onboarding new developers. This includes
    getting started guides, architecture overviews, codebase tours,
    workflow documentation, and team-specific processes.
  why_it_matters: |
    Quality onboarding documentation reduces dependency on senior developers
    for knowledge transfer, enables self-service learning, and scales
    onboarding capacity. Poor documentation forces repeated explanations,
    creates knowledge silos, and extends ramp-up time significantly.
  when_to_run:
  - Before hiring surges
  - After major architectural changes
  - Quarterly documentation review
  - When new hires report confusion

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DOCS-CRIT-001
    signal: No onboarding documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - README only has project name
    - No getting started guide
    - Onboarding relies entirely on mentorship
    explanation: |
      Without documentation, onboarding becomes entirely dependent on
      available team members, creating bottlenecks and inconsistent
      experiences.
    remediation: |
      Create minimum viable onboarding documentation including
      environment setup, codebase overview, and first-task guidance.
  - id: DOCS-CRIT-002
    signal: Documentation contains incorrect information
    evidence_indicators:
    - Commands that don't work
    - References to removed systems
    - Outdated architecture diagrams
    explanation: |
      Incorrect documentation is worse than no documentation as it
      wastes time and erodes trust in all documentation.
    remediation: |
      Implement documentation testing and review processes. Add
      last-updated dates and owners to all documents.
  high:
  - id: DOCS-HIGH-001
    signal: Documentation assumes significant prior context
    remediation: |
      Review documentation from a newcomer's perspective. Define
      all acronyms and link to prerequisite knowledge.
  - id: DOCS-HIGH-002
    signal: Architecture documentation missing or outdated
    remediation: |
      Create or update architecture documentation with current
      system diagrams and component descriptions.
  - id: DOCS-HIGH-003
    signal: No clear documentation ownership
    remediation: |
      Assign documentation owners and establish review cadence.
  medium:
  - id: DOCS-MED-001
    signal: Documentation scattered across multiple systems
    remediation: |
      Consolidate or create clear navigation between documentation
      locations. Consider a documentation hub.
  - id: DOCS-MED-002
    signal: Documentation lacks visual aids
    remediation: |
      Add diagrams, screenshots, and examples to improve
      comprehension and reduce ambiguity.
  - id: DOCS-MED-003
    signal: No troubleshooting section
    remediation: |
      Document common issues and their resolutions based on
      support requests and new hire feedback.
  low:
  - id: DOCS-LOW-001
    signal: Documentation formatting inconsistent
    remediation: |
      Establish style guide and apply linting tools for
      consistent documentation.
  - id: DOCS-LOW-002
    signal: No documentation search functionality
    remediation: |
      Implement search or improve documentation organization
      for easier discovery.
