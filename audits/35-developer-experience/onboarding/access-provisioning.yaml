description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the process for provisioning new developers with necessary
    access to repositories, cloud environments, internal tools, documentation
    systems, and communication platforms. Assesses automation level, time to
    complete provisioning, and clarity of the access request process.
  why_it_matters: |
    Delayed or incomplete access provisioning blocks developer productivity
    from day one. When developers cannot access systems they need, they
    cannot contribute effectively. Manual, ad-hoc provisioning also creates
    security risks through inconsistent access controls and orphaned accounts.
  when_to_run:
  - Before hiring new developers
  - When access issues frequently reported
  - After security access reviews
  - Quarterly for process health

  interview_questions:
  - role: New Developer
    questions:
    - How long did it take to get all necessary access?
    - What access was missing when you started?
    - How did you request access to systems?
    - Were there clear instructions for access requests?
  - role: IT/Security
    questions:
    - What is the standard access provisioning process?
    - How is access provisioning automated?
    - What is the typical provisioning timeline?
    - How do you ensure consistency in access grants?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ACCESS-CRIT-001
    signal: Access provisioning takes more than 3 days
    evidence_indicators:
    - Developers blocked waiting for access
    - Manual ticket-based provisioning
    - No SLA for access requests
    explanation: |
      Extended access provisioning blocks productivity and wastes
      expensive developer time waiting instead of contributing.
    remediation: |
      Implement automated provisioning with role-based access
      bundles. Set and track provisioning SLAs.
  - id: ACCESS-CRIT-002
    signal: No documented access requirements by role
    evidence_indicators:
    - Managers guess what access is needed
    - Access granted reactively as requests come
    - Inconsistent access across team members
    explanation: |
      Without clear role definitions, access is either over-granted
      (security risk) or under-granted (productivity blocker).
    remediation: |
      Define standard access profiles by role with documented
      justification for each permission.
  high:
  - id: ACCESS-HIGH-001
    signal: Access provisioning entirely manual
    remediation: |
      Implement automated provisioning through identity management
      integration with SCIM or similar protocols.
  - id: ACCESS-HIGH-002
    signal: No access request tracking
    remediation: |
      Implement ticketing or workflow system for access requests
      with visibility into status and history.
  - id: ACCESS-HIGH-003
    signal: Production access granted to new developers immediately
    remediation: |
      Implement graduated access with production access requiring
      demonstrated competency or manager approval.
  medium:
  - id: ACCESS-MED-001
    signal: Access instructions scattered across documents
    remediation: |
      Consolidate access information into single onboarding
      checklist with clear ownership.
  - id: ACCESS-MED-002
    signal: No verification that access works
    remediation: |
      Add access verification step to onboarding checklist
      to confirm all systems accessible.
  - id: ACCESS-MED-003
    signal: No self-service access request portal
    remediation: |
      Implement self-service access catalog for common
      access requests with automated approval workflows.
  low:
  - id: ACCESS-LOW-001
    signal: Access provisioning metrics not tracked
    remediation: |
      Track time-to-access metrics for continuous improvement.
  - id: ACCESS-LOW-002
    signal: No feedback collection on access experience
    remediation: |
      Include access experience questions in onboarding surveys.
