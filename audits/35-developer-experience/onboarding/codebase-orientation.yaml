description:
  what: |
    Evaluates how new developers are introduced to the codebase structure,
    key components, design patterns, and conventions. Assesses availability
    of codebase tours, architecture documentation, code walkthroughs, and
    resources that help developers understand where to find things.
  why_it_matters: |
    Large codebases are overwhelming for new developers. Without proper
    orientation, developers waste significant time searching for code,
    understanding patterns, or making changes inconsistent with existing
    conventions. Good orientation transforms a codebase from a maze into
    a navigable system.
  when_to_run:
  - Before onboarding new developers
  - After major refactoring
  - When codebase structure changes
  - Annually for maintenance

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ORIENT-CRIT-001
    signal: No codebase orientation materials exist
    evidence_indicators:
    - New developers rely entirely on asking questions
    - No architecture documentation
    - No recorded walkthroughs
    explanation: |
      Without orientation materials, every new developer must
      rediscover the codebase structure through trial and error,
      wasting weeks of productivity.
    remediation: |
      Create minimum viable orientation including high-level
      architecture, key directories, and common patterns.
  - id: ORIENT-CRIT-002
    signal: Architecture documentation completely outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - References removed services
    - Missing major components
    - Incorrect dependency relationships
    explanation: |
      Outdated documentation misleads developers and erodes
      trust in all documentation.
    remediation: |
      Schedule architecture documentation review and update.
      Implement processes to keep documentation current.
  high:
  - id: ORIENT-HIGH-001
    signal: No visual architecture diagrams
    remediation: |
      Create C4 or similar architecture diagrams showing system
      context, containers, and key components.
  - id: ORIENT-HIGH-002
    signal: Coding conventions undocumented
    remediation: |
      Document project conventions or implement automated
      enforcement through linting and formatters.
  - id: ORIENT-HIGH-003
    signal: No explanation of project structure
    remediation: |
      Create directory structure documentation explaining
      the purpose of each major directory.
  medium:
  - id: ORIENT-MED-001
    signal: No recorded codebase walkthrough
    remediation: |
      Record video walkthrough of codebase for async
      consumption by new developers.
  - id: ORIENT-MED-002
    signal: ADRs not maintained
    remediation: |
      Establish ADR process and document key past decisions.
  - id: ORIENT-MED-003
    signal: No code search solution
    remediation: |
      Implement Sourcegraph or similar code search to help
      developers find code efficiently.
  low:
  - id: ORIENT-LOW-001
    signal: Architecture diagrams not version controlled
    remediation: |
      Store diagrams as code (Mermaid, PlantUML) in repository.
  - id: ORIENT-LOW-002
    signal: No glossary of domain terms
    remediation: |
      Create glossary of project-specific terminology.
