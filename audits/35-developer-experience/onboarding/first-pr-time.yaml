description:
  what: |
    Measures and analyzes the time it takes for new developers to submit and
    merge their first pull request after joining the team. This metric serves
    as a key indicator of onboarding effectiveness and development environment
    maturity, encompassing environment setup, codebase understanding, and
    workflow familiarity.
  why_it_matters: |
    First PR time directly correlates with developer productivity ramp-up and
    satisfaction. Extended onboarding periods waste engineering capacity,
    frustrate new hires, and can indicate systemic issues with documentation,
    tooling, or knowledge transfer. DORA research shows that elite teams have
    significantly faster onboarding cycles.
  when_to_run:
  - After each new developer joins
  - Quarterly for trend analysis
  - Before major hiring initiatives
  - When refactoring onboarding processes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FPRTIME-CRIT-001
    signal: First PR takes more than 2 weeks
    evidence_indicators:
    - Blocked by environment issues
    - Unclear onboarding tasks
    - Complex codebase without guidance
    - Missing documentation for key systems
    explanation: |
      Two weeks without a meaningful contribution indicates severe
      onboarding friction. This delays value delivery, frustrates
      new hires, and suggests systemic issues requiring immediate
      attention.
    remediation: |
      Create structured onboarding with dedicated starter tasks,
      assign onboarding buddies, and ensure environment setup is
      fully automated.
  - id: FPRTIME-CRIT-002
    signal: New developers abandon first PR due to complexity
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple abandoned draft PRs
    - Escalating scope of initial tasks
    - Reassignment of onboarding work
    explanation: |
      When new developers cannot complete their initial tasks, it
      damages confidence and indicates poor task scoping or
      inadequate support systems.
    remediation: |
      Create a curated list of well-scoped starter issues labeled
      as 'good first issue' with clear acceptance criteria.
  high:
  - id: FPRTIME-HIGH-001
    signal: First PR takes 5-10 business days
    remediation: |
      Review environment setup process and identify bottlenecks.
      Consider implementing devcontainers or automated setup scripts.
  - id: FPRTIME-HIGH-002
    signal: First PRs consistently require extensive rework
    remediation: |
      Improve code style documentation, implement linting, and
      ensure PR templates guide contributors effectively.
  medium:
  - id: FPRTIME-MED-001
    signal: First PR takes 3-5 business days
    remediation: |
      Optimize documentation and consider pairing new developers
      with experienced team members for their first task.
  - id: FPRTIME-MED-002
    signal: No standardized first task for new developers
    remediation: |
      Create a backlog of appropriately-scoped onboarding tasks
      labeled for new team members.
  low:
  - id: FPRTIME-LOW-001
    signal: First PR metrics not tracked
    remediation: |
      Implement tracking of onboarding milestones including first
      PR submission and merge times.
  - id: FPRTIME-LOW-002
    signal: Inconsistent first PR experiences across teams
    remediation: |
      Standardize onboarding process organization-wide with
      shared best practices and templates.
