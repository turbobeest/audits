  what: |
    This audit examines audit findings risk management:
    - Finding tracking and management
    - Remediation progress and timeliness
    - Root cause analysis
    - Finding severity assessment
    - Repeat finding prevention
    - Management oversight
    - Escalation for overdue items
  why_it_matters: |
    Audit findings represent identified risks requiring attention:
    - Open findings are known unmitigated risks
    - Regulators expect timely remediation
    - Repeat findings indicate systemic issues
    - Overdue findings increase risk exposure
    - SOX and other regulations require finding management
    - ISO 31000 includes finding remediation in risk treatment
    - Finding trends indicate control effectiveness
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly finding review
  - Before external audits
  - When findings are overdue
  - During compliance reviews
  - After major audits

signals:
  critical:
  - id: AUDFIND-CRIT-001
    signal: Audit findings not tracked systematically
    evidence_indicators:
    - No finding tracker
    - Findings in email only
    - Status unknown
    explanation: |
      Without systematic tracking, findings may be lost or ignored,
      leaving known risks unaddressed.
    remediation: |
      - Implement finding tracker
      - Consolidate all findings
      - Assign ownership
      - Track to closure
  - id: AUDFIND-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical findings significantly overdue
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical findings open
    - Past remediation dates
    - No escalation
    explanation: |
      Overdue critical findings represent unmitigated significant
      risks. Extended exposure increases impact.
    remediation: |
      - Escalate critical findings
      - Expedite remediation
      - Provide resources
      - Track to completion
  high:
  - id: AUDFIND-HIGH-001
    signal: Repeat findings occurring
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same issues recurring
    - Root cause not addressed
    - Ineffective remediation
    explanation: |
      Repeat findings indicate systemic issues or ineffective
      remediation. Root causes must be addressed.
    remediation: |
      - Identify repeat findings
      - Conduct root cause analysis
      - Address systemic issues
      - Verify sustainability
  - id: AUDFIND-HIGH-002
    signal: No remediation timeline enforcement
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dates not tracked
    - No accountability
    - Delays not escalated
    explanation: |
      Timeline enforcement ensures timely remediation.
      Without it, findings languish indefinitely.
    remediation: |
      - Enforce timelines
      - Track target dates
      - Escalate delays
      - Hold owners accountable
  medium:
  - id: AUDFIND-MED-001
    signal: No root cause analysis for findings
    evidence_indicators:
    - Symptoms addressed only
    - No root cause
    - Quick fixes
    explanation: |
      Root cause analysis prevents recurrence. Without it,
      the same issues will generate future findings.
    remediation: |
      - Require root cause analysis
      - Address underlying causes
      - Prevent recurrence
      - Document analysis
  - id: AUDFIND-MED-002
    signal: Finding severity not assessed
    evidence_indicators:
    - All findings equal
    - No prioritization
    - Resources misallocated
    explanation: |
      Severity assessment enables prioritization. Without it,
      critical findings may not receive appropriate attention.
    remediation: |
      - Assess finding severity
      - Prioritize accordingly
      - Allocate resources
      - Focus on critical items
  low:
  - id: AUDFIND-LOW-001
    signal: Finding trends not analyzed
    evidence_indicators:
    - No trend analysis
    - Patterns not identified
    - Limited insight
    explanation: |
      Trend analysis reveals patterns and control effectiveness.
      It enables proactive improvement.
    remediation: |
      - Analyze finding trends
      - Identify patterns
      - Address root causes
      - Report to leadership
  positive:
  - id: AUDFIND-POS-001
    signal: Effective finding management
    evidence_indicators:
    - Systematic tracking
    - Timely remediation
    - No overdue items
  - id: AUDFIND-POS-002
    signal: Proactive improvement from findings
    evidence_indicators:
    - Root cause addressed
    - No repeat findings
    - Continuous improvement
