  what: |
    This audit examines internal policy compliance risk:
    - Policy awareness and communication
    - Compliance monitoring mechanisms
    - Violation detection and tracking
    - Enforcement consistency
    - Risk from non-compliance
    - Exception management
    - Compliance metrics and reporting
  why_it_matters: |
    Internal policy compliance is foundational to governance:
    - Policies implement regulatory requirements
    - Non-compliance creates operational and legal risk
    - Policy violations may indicate control weaknesses
    - Inconsistent enforcement undermines policy effectiveness
    - ISO 31000 includes policy in governance context
    - Policy compliance often flows to external compliance
    - Culture of compliance supports overall risk posture
  when_to_run:
  - Annual policy review
  - When violations increase
  - During culture assessments
  - After policy changes
  - During compliance audits

signals:
  critical:
  - id: POLRISK-CRIT-001
    signal: No policy compliance monitoring
    evidence_indicators:
    - No monitoring mechanisms
    - Compliance unknown
    - No measurement
    explanation: |
      Without monitoring, policy compliance is unknown.
      Violations may go undetected and unaddressed.
    remediation: |
      - Implement monitoring
      - Measure compliance
      - Detect violations
      - Track trends
  - id: POLRISK-CRIT-002
    signal: Widespread policy non-compliance
    evidence_indicators:
    - High violation rates
    - Systemic non-compliance
    - Policy ignored
    explanation: |
      Widespread non-compliance undermines governance and
      creates significant operational and legal risk.
    remediation: |
      - Assess root causes
      - Reinforce policies
      - Enforce consistently
      - Address systemic issues
  high:
  - id: POLRISK-HIGH-001
    signal: Policy violations not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No violation tracking
    - Incidents not recorded
    - History unknown
    explanation: |
      Without tracking, patterns cannot be identified and
      enforcement cannot be consistent.
    remediation: |
      - Implement tracking
      - Record violations
      - Analyze patterns
      - Enable enforcement
  - id: POLRISK-HIGH-002
    signal: Inconsistent policy enforcement
    evidence_indicators:
    - Selective enforcement
    - Inconsistent consequences
    - Favoritism
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent enforcement undermines policy credibility
      and creates legal exposure.
    remediation: |
      - Enforce consistently
      - Document decisions
      - Apply consequences fairly
      - Audit enforcement
  medium:
  - id: POLRISK-MED-001
    signal: Exception process not formal
    evidence_indicators:
    - Informal exceptions
    - Not documented
    - No approval
    explanation: |
      Exceptions need formal process to ensure appropriate
      consideration and risk acceptance.
    remediation: |
      - Formalize exception process
      - Require approval
      - Document exceptions
      - Track expiration
  - id: POLRISK-MED-002
    signal: Policy awareness insufficient
    evidence_indicators:
    - Employees unaware
    - No training
    - Policies not communicated
    explanation: |
      Compliance requires awareness. Without communication
      and training, compliance cannot be expected.
    remediation: |
      - Communicate policies
      - Provide training
      - Verify awareness
      - Enable access
  low:
  - id: POLRISK-LOW-001
    signal: Compliance metrics not reported
    evidence_indicators:
    - No reporting
    - Leadership unaware
    - No visibility
    explanation: |
      Reporting enables leadership oversight and
      demonstrates governance effectiveness.
    remediation: |
      - Report compliance metrics
      - Include in governance reporting
      - Enable oversight
      - Support decisions
  positive:
  - id: POLRISK-POS-001
    signal: Effective policy compliance
    evidence_indicators:
    - High compliance rates
    - Active monitoring
    - Consistent enforcement
  - id: POLRISK-POS-002
    signal: Strong compliance culture
    evidence_indicators:
    - Employee awareness
    - Self-compliance
    - Few violations
