  what: |
    This audit examines crisis communication capabilities:
    - Communication plan documentation
    - Stakeholder identification and contact information
    - Notification procedures and escalation
    - Communication channels and redundancy
    - Message templates and approval
    - Media and public communication
    - Post-incident communication
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective crisis communication is essential to incident response:
    - Stakeholders need timely, accurate information
    - ISO 22301 requires communication procedures
    - Poor communication damages reputation and trust
    - Communication failures compound incident impact
    - Regulatory requirements often mandate notification
    - Coordinated response requires clear communication
    - Multiple channels ensure message delivery
  when_to_run:
  - Annual BCP review
  - After communication failures
  - When stakeholder base changes
  - Before regulatory audits
  - After organizational changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CRCOMM-CRIT-001
    signal: No crisis communication plan
    evidence_indicators:
    - No communication procedures
    - No stakeholder notification plan
    - Ad-hoc communication
    explanation: |
      Without a plan, communication during crises is chaotic.
      Stakeholders may not be informed appropriately or timely.
    remediation: |
      - Develop crisis communication plan
      - Document procedures
      - Identify stakeholders
      - Test communication capability
  - id: CRCOMM-CRIT-002
    signal: Contact information not maintained
    evidence_indicators:
    - Outdated contacts
    - Missing stakeholders
    - No update process
    explanation: |
      Accurate contact information is essential for notification.
      Outdated information means stakeholders cannot be reached.
    remediation: |
      - Update contact lists
      - Implement maintenance process
      - Verify contact information
      - Include all stakeholders
  high:
  - id: CRCOMM-HIGH-001
    signal: Single communication channel
    evidence_indicators:
    - No channel redundancy
    - Email only
    - Single point of failure
    explanation: |
      Communication channels may fail during incidents. Multiple
      channels ensure messages can be delivered.
    remediation: |
      - Implement multiple channels
      - Include out-of-band communication
      - Test all channels
      - Plan for channel failure
  - id: CRCOMM-HIGH-002
    signal: No escalation procedures
    evidence_indicators:
    - No escalation paths
    - Unclear who to notify
    - No severity-based escalation
    explanation: |
      Escalation ensures appropriate parties are engaged based
      on incident severity. Without it, response may be inadequate.
    remediation: |
      - Define escalation procedures
      - Map escalation paths
      - Align with incident severity
      - Document and test
  medium:
  - id: CRCOMM-MED-001
    signal: No pre-approved message templates
    evidence_indicators:
    - No templates
    - Messages drafted during crisis
    - Approval delays
    explanation: |
      Pre-approved templates enable rapid, consistent communication.
      Drafting messages during crisis causes delays and errors.
    remediation: |
      - Develop message templates
      - Pre-approve common scenarios
      - Include required elements
      - Enable rapid deployment
  - id: CRCOMM-MED-002
    signal: External communication not planned
    evidence_indicators:
    - No media plan
    - No public communication
    - Internal focus only
    explanation: |
      External stakeholders need communication too. Unplanned
      external communication damages reputation.
    remediation: |
      - Plan external communication
      - Designate spokespersons
      - Develop media protocols
      - Prepare public statements
  low:
  - id: CRCOMM-LOW-001
    signal: Communication not tested
    evidence_indicators:
    - Untested procedures
    - No communication drills
    - Unknown capability
    explanation: |
      Testing validates communication capability. Untested
      procedures may fail during actual incidents.
    remediation: |
      - Test communication procedures
      - Conduct notification drills
      - Validate contact information
      - Measure response times
  positive:
  - id: CRCOMM-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive crisis communication
    evidence_indicators:
    - Complete plan
    - Current contacts
    - Multiple channels
  - id: CRCOMM-POS-002
    signal: Tested communication capability
    evidence_indicators:
    - Regular testing
    - Validated contacts
    - Known response times
