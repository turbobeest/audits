  what: |
    This audit examines Business Continuity Plan documentation:
    - BCP scope and coverage of critical functions
    - Plan structure and organization
    - Currency and maintenance of plans
    - Accessibility during incidents
    - Version control and change management
    - Contact information and roles
    - Integration with other plans
  why_it_matters: |
    BCP documentation enables effective crisis response:
    - ISO 22301 requires documented business continuity plans
    - Plans must be accessible when needed during disruptions
    - Stale plans provide false assurance
    - Incomplete plans leave gaps in recovery capability
    - NIST emphasizes contingency planning documentation
    - Regulatory frameworks often require BCPs
    - Plans without proper documentation cannot be executed reliably
  when_to_run:
  - Annual BCP review
  - After organizational changes
  - During compliance audits
  - Before major system changes
  - After incidents revealing gaps

signals:
  critical:
  - id: BCPDOC-CRIT-001
    signal: No Business Continuity Plan documentation exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No BCP documents found
    - No continuity planning
    - No recovery procedures documented
    explanation: |
      ISO 22301 requires documented BCPs. Without plans, organizations
      cannot respond effectively to disruptions.
    remediation: |
      - Develop Business Continuity Plans
      - Document recovery procedures
      - Cover all critical functions
      - Maintain plan currency
  - id: BCPDOC-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical functions not covered in BCP
    evidence_indicators:
    - Missing critical functions
    - Incomplete scope
    - Gaps in coverage
    explanation: |
      BCPs must cover all critical functions. Gaps leave the
      organization unable to recover essential capabilities.
    remediation: |
      - Identify all critical functions
      - Ensure complete coverage
      - Document recovery for each
      - Review coverage regularly
  high:
  - id: BCPDOC-HIGH-001
    signal: BCP significantly outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Plans not updated in 2+ years
    - Obsolete contact information
    - Stale procedures
    explanation: |
      Outdated BCPs may not reflect current systems, processes, or
      personnel. Stale plans may fail when executed.
    remediation: |
      - Update BCPs immediately
      - Verify contact information
      - Review procedures for currency
      - Establish update schedule
  - id: BCPDOC-HIGH-002
    signal: BCP not accessible during incidents
    evidence_indicators:
    - Plans stored only internally
    - No offline access
    - Single point of storage
    explanation: |
      BCPs must be accessible during disruptions when primary systems
      may be unavailable. Single storage points may be inaccessible.
    remediation: |
      - Store plans in multiple locations
      - Enable offline access
      - Provide key personnel copies
      - Test accessibility
  medium:
  - id: BCPDOC-MED-001
    signal: BCP lacks clear roles and responsibilities
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unclear who does what
    - Missing role assignments
    - No contact information
    explanation: |
      Clear roles enable coordinated response. Ambiguous responsibilities
      cause delays and confusion during incidents.
    remediation: |
      - Define roles clearly
      - Assign responsibilities
      - Document contact information
      - Establish alternates
  - id: BCPDOC-MED-002
    signal: No version control for BCPs
    evidence_indicators:
    - No version tracking
    - Multiple uncontrolled copies
    - Unknown current version
    explanation: |
      Version control ensures everyone uses current plans. Uncontrolled
      copies lead to confusion and outdated procedures.
    remediation: |
      - Implement version control
      - Mark all versions clearly
      - Control distribution
      - Retire old versions
  low:
  - id: BCPDOC-LOW-001
    signal: BCP not integrated with other plans
    evidence_indicators:
    - Standalone BCP
    - No DR integration
    - Separate crisis plans
    explanation: |
      Integration ensures coordinated response across plan types.
      Isolated plans may conflict or miss dependencies.
    remediation: |
      - Integrate with DR plans
      - Coordinate with crisis plans
      - Document dependencies
      - Test integrated response
  positive:
  - id: BCPDOC-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive BCP documentation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Complete coverage
    - Current and maintained
    - Accessible when needed
  - id: BCPDOC-POS-002
    signal: Well-managed BCP lifecycle
    evidence_indicators:
    - Version controlled
    - Regular updates
    - Integrated with other plans
