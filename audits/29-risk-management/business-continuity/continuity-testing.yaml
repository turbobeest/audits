  what: |
    This audit examines business continuity testing practices:
    - Testing frequency and schedule
    - Test scope and coverage
    - Test types (tabletop, simulation, full)
    - Test documentation and results
    - Issue identification and remediation
    - Lessons learned incorporation
    - Stakeholder participation
  why_it_matters: |
    Testing validates business continuity capability:
    - Untested plans may fail when needed
    - ISO 22301 requires regular testing and exercises
    - Testing reveals gaps before actual incidents
    - Regular testing builds organizational capability
    - Stakeholder familiarity comes from practice
    - Test results drive improvement
    - Compliance often requires testing evidence
  when_to_run:
  - Annual BCP review
  - After plan updates
  - Before compliance audits
  - When testing capability is questioned
  - After failed tests

signals:
  critical:
  - id: BCTEST-CRIT-001
    signal: No continuity testing performed
    evidence_indicators:
    - No test evidence
    - Plans never tested
    - No test schedule
    explanation: |
      Untested plans may fail when needed. ISO 22301 requires testing
      to validate continuity capability.
    remediation: |
      - Establish testing program
      - Schedule regular tests
      - Document test plans
      - Track test results
  - id: BCTEST-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical systems not tested
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical systems excluded
    - Incomplete coverage
    - Key functions untested
    explanation: |
      Critical systems must be tested to ensure recoverability.
      Untested critical systems represent significant risk.
    remediation: |
      - Include critical systems
      - Ensure complete coverage
      - Prioritize critical testing
      - Document coverage
  high:
  - id: BCTEST-HIGH-001
    signal: Tests not performed regularly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Infrequent testing
    - Tests not scheduled
    - Long gaps between tests
    explanation: |
      Regular testing maintains capability. Infrequent testing
      allows plans to become stale and personnel unfamiliar.
    remediation: |
      - Test at least annually
      - Schedule tests in advance
      - Maintain test calendar
      - Track test completion
  - id: BCTEST-HIGH-002
    signal: Test findings not remediated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unresolved issues
    - Repeated failures
    - No improvement tracking
    explanation: |
      Testing value comes from improvement. Unremediated findings
      mean the same issues will cause failure in actual incidents.
    remediation: |
      - Track all findings
      - Remediate issues
      - Verify fixes
      - Prevent recurrence
  medium:
  - id: BCTEST-MED-001
    signal: Limited test types used
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only tabletop exercises
    - No full-scale tests
    - Limited simulation
    explanation: |
      Different test types serve different purposes. Limited types
      may miss issues that other tests would reveal.
    remediation: |
      - Use multiple test types
      - Include tabletop and simulation
      - Conduct full-scale tests periodically
      - Match test type to objective
  - id: BCTEST-MED-002
    signal: Key stakeholders not participating
    evidence_indicators:
    - Limited participation
    - Key roles absent
    - IT-only tests
    explanation: |
      Stakeholder participation builds capability. Tests without
      key participants do not validate full response.
    remediation: |
      - Include key stakeholders
      - Require participation
      - Test roles and responsibilities
      - Build organizational capability
  low:
  - id: BCTEST-LOW-001
    signal: Lessons learned not incorporated
    evidence_indicators:
    - No lessons learned process
    - Findings not incorporated
    - Repeated issues
    explanation: |
      Lessons learned drive improvement. Without incorporation,
      the same issues recur.
    remediation: |
      - Capture lessons learned
      - Incorporate into plans
      - Update procedures
      - Prevent recurrence
  positive:
  - id: BCTEST-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive testing program
    evidence_indicators:
    - Regular testing
    - Complete coverage
    - Multiple test types
  - id: BCTEST-POS-002
    signal: Effective improvement cycle
    evidence_indicators:
    - Findings remediated
    - Lessons incorporated
    - Continuous improvement
