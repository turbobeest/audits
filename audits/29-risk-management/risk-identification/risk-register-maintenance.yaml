  what: |
    This audit examines the organization's risk register maintenance practices:
    - Risk register structure and content completeness
    - Currency and timeliness of risk entries
    - Quality of risk descriptions and assessments
    - Ownership and accountability assignments
    - Version control and change tracking
    - Access controls and security of risk data
    - Integration with risk management workflows
  why_it_matters: |
    The risk register is the central repository for organizational risk information:
    - ISO 31000 requires documented information about risks and their treatment
    - An outdated or incomplete risk register provides false assurance
    - Risk-based decisions depend on accurate, current risk data
    - Regulatory auditors expect to see well-maintained risk registers
    - COBIT emphasizes maintaining an inventory of risks as a key practice
    - Poor register maintenance undermines the entire risk management program
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly risk management reviews
  - Annual compliance audits
  - Before board or executive risk reporting
  - During internal audit assessments
  - After organizational changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RISKRG-CRIT-001
    signal: No risk register exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented risk inventory
    - Risks tracked informally or not at all
    - No central repository for risk information
    explanation: |
      A risk register is fundamental to risk management. ISO 31000 requires
      documented information about risks. Without a register, risk management
      activities cannot be coordinated, tracked, or reported.
    remediation: |
      - Establish a formal risk register
      - Define required fields and data structure
      - Populate with existing known risks
      - Implement access controls and governance
  - id: RISKRG-CRIT-002
    signal: Risk register severely outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - No updates in over 12 months
    - Risks from previous years not closed or reviewed
    - Significant changes not reflected in register
    explanation: |
      A severely outdated risk register provides false assurance and cannot
      support risk-based decisions. The risk landscape changes continuously,
      and the register must reflect current reality.
    remediation: |
      - Conduct comprehensive risk register review
      - Update all risk entries with current status
      - Close or archive obsolete risks
      - Implement regular update schedule
  high:
  - id: RISKRG-HIGH-001
    signal: Risk entries missing required fields
    evidence_indicators:
    - Risks without likelihood or impact assessments
    - Missing risk owners
    - No treatment plans documented
    explanation: |
      Incomplete risk entries cannot support effective risk management.
      Essential fields like likelihood, impact, owner, and treatment plan
      are necessary for prioritization and accountability.
    remediation: |
      - Define mandatory fields for all risk entries
      - Implement validation to prevent incomplete entries
      - Review and complete existing entries
      - Train risk owners on required documentation
  - id: RISKRG-HIGH-002
    signal: Risk ownership not assigned or unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - Risks without designated owners
    - Owners no longer with organization
    - Generic ownership (e.g., 'IT Department')
    explanation: |
      Clear risk ownership is essential for accountability. ISO 31000
      emphasizes that someone must be accountable for risk treatment.
      Without individual ownership, risks are neglected.
    remediation: |
      - Assign individual owners to all risks
      - Verify owner assignments are current
      - Update owners when personnel change
      - Define backup owners for key risks
  - id: RISKRG-HIGH-003
    signal: No version control or change tracking
    evidence_indicators:
    - No history of risk register changes
    - Unable to see how risks evolved
    - No audit trail for modifications
    explanation: |
      Version control supports governance and enables understanding of how
      risks evolve over time. Audit requirements often mandate demonstrating
      risk management activities over time.
    remediation: |
      - Implement version control for risk register
      - Track all changes with timestamps and users
      - Maintain historical snapshots
      - Document change rationale
  medium:
  - id: RISKRG-MED-001
    signal: Risk descriptions lack sufficient detail
    evidence_indicators:
    - Vague or generic risk descriptions
    - No context or scenarios documented
    - Inconsistent description formats
    explanation: |
      Detailed risk descriptions are necessary for accurate assessment and
      effective treatment. Vague descriptions lead to misunderstanding and
      inappropriate responses.
    remediation: |
      - Define risk description standards
      - Include cause-event-consequence structure
      - Provide examples and templates
      - Review and enhance existing descriptions
  - id: RISKRG-MED-002
    signal: Risk register not integrated with workflows
    evidence_indicators:
    - Manual processes for risk updates
    - No connection to incident management
    - Isolated from project risk processes
    explanation: |
      Integration with organizational workflows ensures the risk register
      stays current and relevant. Isolated registers quickly become outdated
      and disconnected from actual risk activities.
    remediation: |
      - Integrate risk register with GRC tools
      - Connect to incident management processes
      - Link project risks to enterprise register
      - Automate status updates where possible
  low:
  - id: RISKRG-LOW-001
    signal: Risk register access not optimized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Difficult to search or filter risks
    - No reporting capabilities
    - Poor user experience
    explanation: |
      User-friendly access encourages engagement with the risk register.
      Difficult access leads to reduced usage and outdated information.
    remediation: |
      - Implement search and filter capabilities
      - Create standard views and reports
      - Improve user interface
      - Provide dashboard summaries
  positive:
  - id: RISKRG-POS-001
    signal: Well-maintained risk register with complete entries
    evidence_indicators:

    - Regular updates within 90 days
    - Clear ownership assignments
  - id: RISKRG-POS-002
    signal: Risk register integrated with management processes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Connected to GRC platform
    - Automated status updates
    - Integrated with incident management
