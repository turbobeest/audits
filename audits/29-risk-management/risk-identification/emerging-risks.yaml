  what: |
    This audit examines processes for identifying and monitoring emerging risks:
    - Horizon scanning and environmental monitoring
    - Early warning indicators and signals
    - Technology trend analysis
    - Regulatory change monitoring
    - Industry and competitive intelligence
    - Scenario planning and futures analysis
    - Emerging risk reporting and escalation
  why_it_matters: |
    Emerging risk identification provides early warning of future threats:
    - COSO ERM emphasizes the need to anticipate emerging risks
    - By the time a risk is well-understood, response options may be limited
    - Proactive identification enables strategic planning and preparation
    - Regulatory changes and technology shifts can disrupt unprepared organizations
    - According to WEF Global Risks Report, most significant impacts come
      from risks that organizations failed to anticipate
    - ISO 31000 notes that risk context changes over time requiring monitoring
  when_to_run:
  - Annual strategic planning cycles
  - Quarterly risk reviews
  - Following industry disruptions or events
  - During technology strategy reviews
  - After regulatory announcements

signals:
  critical:
  - id: EMRISK-CRIT-001
    signal: No emerging risk identification process exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No horizon scanning activities
    - No emerging risk section in risk register
    - No monitoring of technology or regulatory trends
    explanation: |
      Without emerging risk identification, organizations are reactive rather
      than proactive. COSO ERM emphasizes that risk assessment should consider
      emerging risks alongside current risks. Organizations without this
      capability are consistently surprised by foreseeable events.
    remediation: |
      - Establish horizon scanning process
      - Define emerging risk categories to monitor
      - Implement regulatory change monitoring
      - Create emerging risk section in risk register
      - Schedule regular emerging risk review sessions
  - id: EMRISK-CRIT-002
    signal: Emerging risks not integrated into strategic planning
    evidence_indicators:
    - Strategic plans do not reference emerging risks
    - No scenario planning for future risks
    - Investment decisions ignore emerging threats
    explanation: |
      Emerging risks must inform strategic decisions. Failing to consider
      future threats in strategic planning can lead to investments that
      are undermined by predictable changes.
    remediation: |
      - Include emerging risks in strategic planning process
      - Conduct scenario planning exercises
      - Assess strategy resilience against emerging threats
      - Update investment criteria to include emerging risk factors
  high:
  - id: EMRISK-HIGH-001
    signal: Limited sources for emerging risk intelligence
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reliance on single information source
    - No industry intelligence monitoring
    - No external expert engagement
    explanation: |
      Effective emerging risk identification requires diverse information
      sources. Single-source reliance creates blind spots and delays
      in recognizing developing threats.
    remediation: |
      - Diversify information sources
      - Subscribe to industry intelligence services
      - Engage with external experts and peers
      - Monitor academic and research publications
  - id: EMRISK-HIGH-002
    signal: No early warning indicators defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No metrics tracking emerging risk signals
    - No trigger conditions for escalation
    - Reactive response to emerging risks
    explanation: |
      Early warning indicators enable timely response to emerging risks.
      Without defined indicators, emerging risks are only recognized
      when they are already materializing.
    remediation: |
      - Define early warning indicators for key emerging risks
      - Implement monitoring for warning signals
      - Establish trigger thresholds for escalation
      - Create response playbooks for emerging risk scenarios
  medium:
  - id: EMRISK-MED-001
    signal: Emerging risks not regularly reviewed
    evidence_indicators:
    - No scheduled emerging risk reviews
    - Stale emerging risk assessments
    - Infrequent updates to emerging risk inventory
    explanation: |
      Emerging risks evolve continuously. Regular review ensures that
      assessments remain current and response plans stay relevant.
    remediation: |
      - Schedule quarterly emerging risk reviews
      - Update assessments when conditions change
      - Remove risks that have materialized or dissipated
      - Add newly identified emerging risks
  - id: EMRISK-MED-002
    signal: Emerging risk ownership unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - No owners assigned to emerging risks
    - No accountability for monitoring
    - No responsible party for response planning
    explanation: |
      Clear ownership ensures accountability for monitoring and preparing
      responses to emerging risks before they materialize.
    remediation: |
      - Assign owners to all identified emerging risks
      - Define monitoring responsibilities
      - Establish escalation paths
      - Include emerging risk ownership in role descriptions
  low:
  - id: EMRISK-LOW-001
    signal: Emerging risk analysis not shared broadly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Limited distribution of emerging risk reports
    - Business units unaware of relevant emerging risks
    - No emerging risk communication strategy
    explanation: |
      Broad awareness of emerging risks enables distributed monitoring
      and ensures that relevant parties can incorporate insights into
      their planning.
    remediation: |
      - Distribute emerging risk summaries organization-wide
      - Create targeted communications for specific audiences
      - Include emerging risks in regular risk communications
      - Encourage feedback and additional input
  positive:
  - id: EMRISK-POS-001
    signal: Robust emerging risk identification process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Regular horizon scanning activities
    - Multiple intelligence sources
    - Documented emerging risk inventory
  - id: EMRISK-POS-002
    signal: Emerging risks integrated into decision-making
    evidence_indicators:
    - Strategic plans consider emerging risks
    - Scenario planning exercises conducted
    - Early warning indicators monitored
