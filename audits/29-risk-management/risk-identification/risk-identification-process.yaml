  what: |
    This audit examines the organization's systematic process for identifying risks
    that could affect business objectives, system operations, and security posture:
    - Risk identification methodology and framework alignment
    - Stakeholder involvement and input collection processes
    - Documentation and recording of identified risks
    - Integration with organizational planning and strategy
    - Use of structured techniques (brainstorming, checklists, SWOT, etc.)
    - Coverage of all risk domains (operational, strategic, financial, technical)
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective risk identification is the foundation of enterprise risk management:
    - ISO 31000:2018 emphasizes that risk identification must be systematic,
      structured, and comprehensive to be effective
    - Unidentified risks cannot be assessed, mitigated, or monitored
    - NIST RMF requires organizations to identify risks as the first step
      in the risk management lifecycle
    - Poor risk identification leads to blind spots that can result in
      significant business impact when risks materialize
    - According to ISACA, organizations with mature risk identification
      processes experience 40% fewer unexpected incidents
  when_to_run:
  - Annual risk management program review
  - Before major system implementations or changes
  - Following significant incidents or near-misses
  - During regulatory compliance audits
  - After organizational restructuring

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RISKID-CRIT-001
    signal: No formal risk identification process exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No risk identification methodology documented
    - No risk register or inventory maintained
    - No stakeholder involvement in risk identification
    explanation: |
      ISO 31000 requires organizations to have a systematic process for
      identifying risks. Without a formal process, risk identification
      becomes ad-hoc and incomplete, leaving the organization exposed
      to unrecognized threats and vulnerabilities.
    remediation: |
      - Establish a formal risk identification framework aligned with ISO 31000
      - Define roles and responsibilities for risk identification
      - Create risk identification templates and checklists
      - Implement stakeholder engagement processes
      - Document and maintain a comprehensive risk register
  - id: RISKID-CRIT-002
    signal: Risk identification limited to single domain
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only security risks identified, operational risks ignored
    - No consideration of strategic or financial risks
    - Technical risks not connected to business risks
    explanation: |
      Effective risk management requires identification across all domains:
      strategic, operational, financial, technical, and compliance. Focusing
      on a single domain creates significant blind spots.
    remediation: |
      - Expand risk identification to cover all risk domains
      - Engage cross-functional stakeholders in risk identification
      - Use domain-specific checklists and templates
      - Ensure risk categories align with organizational objectives
  high:
  - id: RISKID-HIGH-001
    signal: Risk identification performed infrequently
    evidence_indicators:
    - Risk identification only during annual reviews
    - No trigger-based risk identification
    - Stale risk register (not updated in 6+ months)
    explanation: |
      Risk landscapes change continuously. ISO 31000 recommends that risk
      identification be dynamic and responsive to changes. Infrequent
      identification leads to missed emerging risks.
    remediation: |
      - Implement continuous risk identification processes
      - Define triggers for ad-hoc risk identification
      - Establish regular risk identification sessions (monthly/quarterly)
      - Integrate risk identification into change management
  - id: RISKID-HIGH-002
    signal: No stakeholder involvement in risk identification
    evidence_indicators:
    - Risk identification performed by single team
    - No input from business units
    - No executive engagement in risk identification
    explanation: |
      Different stakeholders have unique perspectives on risks. ISO 31000
      emphasizes inclusive and comprehensive stakeholder engagement to
      ensure all potential risks are identified.
    remediation: |
      - Establish cross-functional risk identification teams
      - Conduct risk identification workshops with business units
      - Engage executive leadership in strategic risk identification
      - Include external perspectives where appropriate
  medium:
  - id: RISKID-MED-001
    signal: Risk identification techniques not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No standardized approach to risk identification
    - Inconsistent methods across teams
    - No training materials for risk identification
    explanation: |
      Documented techniques ensure consistency and completeness in risk
      identification. Without standardization, the quality of risk
      identification varies significantly.
    remediation: |
      - Document risk identification techniques and methods
      - Create training materials for risk identification
      - Standardize approaches across the organization
      - Review and update techniques periodically
  - id: RISKID-MED-002
    signal: Identified risks lack sufficient detail
    evidence_indicators:
    - Risk descriptions are vague or generic
    - No root cause analysis for identified risks
    - Missing context about risk scenarios
    explanation: |
      Detailed risk descriptions are essential for accurate assessment
      and effective mitigation. Vague descriptions lead to misunderstanding
      and inappropriate responses.
    remediation: |
      - Use structured risk description templates
      - Include root cause analysis in risk identification
      - Document risk scenarios and potential impacts
      - Review and enhance risk descriptions regularly
  low:
  - id: RISKID-LOW-001
    signal: Risk identification sources not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No record of how risks were identified
    - No attribution of risk sources
    - No tracking of identification methods
    explanation: |
      Understanding how risks were identified helps improve the process
      and validate the completeness of risk coverage.
    remediation: |
      - Track the source of each identified risk
      - Document the identification method used
      - Analyze which sources yield the most risks
      - Use source data to improve identification processes
  positive:
  - id: RISKID-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive risk identification framework in place
    evidence_indicators:
    - Documented risk identification methodology
    - Regular risk identification activities
    - Cross-functional stakeholder involvement
    - Multiple identification techniques used
  - id: RISKID-POS-002
    signal: Risk identification integrated with organizational processes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Risk identification in project initiation
    - Change management includes risk identification
    - Strategic planning incorporates risk perspective
