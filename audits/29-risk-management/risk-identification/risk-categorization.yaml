  what: |
    This audit examines how the organization categorizes and classifies risks
    to support effective risk management:
    - Risk taxonomy and category definitions
    - Consistency of categorization across the organization
    - Alignment with industry standards and frameworks
    - Hierarchical organization of risk categories
    - Cross-category risk relationships and dependencies
    - Category-specific treatment strategies
  why_it_matters: |
    Proper risk categorization is essential for effective risk management:
    - Enables aggregation and reporting of risks at different levels
    - Facilitates assignment of risk ownership and accountability
    - Supports identification of systemic and correlated risks
    - Allows for category-specific risk treatment approaches
    - ISO 31000 notes that risk criteria should include how risks are categorized
    - COSO ERM uses risk categories to ensure comprehensive coverage
    - Poor categorization leads to gaps in coverage and inconsistent treatment
  when_to_run:
  - During risk management program implementation
  - When revising risk taxonomy or categories
  - Annual risk management review
  - After significant organizational changes
  - During framework alignment assessments

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RISKCAT-CRIT-001
    signal: No risk taxonomy or categorization scheme defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented risk categories
    - Risks listed without category assignments
    - Ad-hoc categorization by individual assessors
    explanation: |
      Without a defined taxonomy, risk management becomes inconsistent and
      incomplete. COSO ERM emphasizes the importance of risk categories for
      ensuring comprehensive coverage and enabling effective aggregation.
    remediation: |
      - Define a comprehensive risk taxonomy aligned with industry standards
      - Document category definitions and criteria
      - Establish a hierarchical category structure
      - Train staff on category usage and selection
  - id: RISKCAT-CRIT-002
    signal: Major risk domains not covered in taxonomy
    evidence_indicators:
    - Missing strategic risk category
    - Missing operational risk category
    - Missing compliance/regulatory risk category
    explanation: |
      A complete risk taxonomy must cover all relevant domains. Missing
      categories create blind spots where risks may go unidentified and
      unmanaged.
    remediation: |
      - Review taxonomy against industry standards
      - Add missing categories for all risk domains
      - Ensure coverage of organization-specific risk areas
      - Validate taxonomy with cross-functional stakeholders
  high:
  - id: RISKCAT-HIGH-001
    signal: Inconsistent category usage across organization
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same risk categorized differently by different teams
    - Conflicting category definitions
    - No governance over category assignment
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent categorization undermines risk aggregation and reporting.
      It becomes impossible to understand the organization's exposure to
      specific risk types when categorization varies.
    remediation: |
      - Establish category governance and approval processes
      - Create detailed category selection criteria
      - Implement category validation in risk tools
      - Train assessors on consistent category application
  - id: RISKCAT-HIGH-002
    signal: Risk categories too broad or too narrow
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single category contains majority of risks
    - Many categories with only one risk each
    - Categories do not support meaningful aggregation
    explanation: |
      Category granularity must balance detail with manageability. Categories
      that are too broad lose analytical value; categories that are too narrow
      fragment the risk portfolio unnecessarily.
    remediation: |
      - Review category distribution and adjust granularity
      - Split overloaded categories into subcategories
      - Consolidate underutilized categories
      - Establish target distribution guidelines
  medium:
  - id: RISKCAT-MED-001
    signal: Category definitions lack clarity
    evidence_indicators:
    - Ambiguous category descriptions
    - No examples or criteria for category selection
    - Overlapping category definitions
    explanation: |
      Clear category definitions are essential for consistent application.
      Ambiguous definitions lead to subjective interpretation and
      inconsistent categorization.
    remediation: |
      - Document clear, unambiguous category definitions
      - Provide examples for each category
      - Define criteria for distinguishing similar categories
      - Include decision trees for category selection
  - id: RISKCAT-MED-002
    signal: Cross-category relationships not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No mapping between related categories
    - Correlated risks not identified
    - No view of risk interdependencies
    explanation: |
      Risks often span multiple categories or have dependencies. Understanding
      these relationships is critical for comprehensive risk management and
      avoiding cascade effects.
    remediation: |
      - Document relationships between risk categories
      - Identify commonly correlated risk types
      - Map risk dependencies across categories
      - Include cross-category analysis in risk assessments
  low:
  - id: RISKCAT-LOW-001
    signal: Category taxonomy not version controlled
    evidence_indicators:
    - No history of taxonomy changes
    - No approval process for category modifications
    - Unable to track category evolution
    explanation: |
      Version controlling the risk taxonomy supports governance and audit
      trails. It enables understanding of how categorization has evolved
      and ensures changes are properly reviewed.
    remediation: |
      - Implement version control for risk taxonomy
      - Document change history and rationale
      - Establish approval workflow for changes
      - Maintain historical category mappings
  positive:
  - id: RISKCAT-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive risk taxonomy aligned with standards
    evidence_indicators:
    - Well-documented category definitions
    - Coverage of all major risk domains
    - Alignment with ISO 31000 or COSO ERM
  - id: RISKCAT-POS-002
    signal: Consistent category usage with governance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Validation rules for category assignment
    - Regular taxonomy reviews
    - Training on category application
