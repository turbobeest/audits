  what: |
    This audit examines risk reporting practices:
    - Report content and structure
    - Reporting frequency and timeliness
    - Audience-appropriate reporting
    - Board and executive risk reporting
    - Risk dashboards and visualization
    - Trend reporting and comparisons
    - Report distribution and accessibility
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective risk reporting enables informed decision-making:
    - ISO 31000 emphasizes communication as part of risk management
    - Boards and executives need risk visibility for governance
    - Timely reporting enables proactive responses
    - Audience-appropriate content ensures understanding
    - COSO ERM requires reporting on risk and performance
    - Poor reporting leads to uninformed decisions
    - Regulatory expectations often include risk reporting requirements
  when_to_run:
  - Annual risk reporting review
  - When implementing new reporting
  - After board feedback on risk reports
  - During risk governance improvements
  - When evaluating reporting tools

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RSKRPT-CRIT-001
    signal: No risk reporting to board or executives
    evidence_indicators:
    - No board risk reports
    - No executive risk visibility
    - Risk information siloed
    explanation: |
      Board and executive oversight requires risk reporting. Without it,
      governance bodies cannot fulfill their risk oversight responsibilities.
    remediation: |
      - Establish board risk reporting
      - Define executive risk reports
      - Create appropriate content
      - Schedule regular reporting
  - id: RSKRPT-CRIT-002
    signal: Risk reporting significantly delayed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reports months behind current state
    - Stale risk information
    - Cannot see current risk exposure
    explanation: |
      Delayed reporting limits decision value. Risk information must
      be timely to support effective responses.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce reporting lag
      - Automate report generation
      - Implement near-real-time dashboards
      - Define reporting timelines
  high:
  - id: RSKRPT-HIGH-001
    signal: Report content not audience-appropriate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Technical jargon for non-technical audience
    - Too detailed for executives
    - Missing context for decision-makers
    explanation: |
      Effective reporting requires content tailored to the audience.
      Inappropriate content limits understanding and value.
    remediation: |
      - Design reports for specific audiences
      - Use executive summaries for leadership
      - Provide appropriate detail levels
      - Include decision-relevant context
  - id: RSKRPT-HIGH-002
    signal: No trend reporting or comparisons
    evidence_indicators:
    - Point-in-time only
    - No historical comparison
    - Cannot see risk trajectory
    explanation: |
      Trend reporting shows risk trajectory over time. Without trends,
      it is difficult to assess whether risk exposure is improving
      or deteriorating.
    remediation: |
      - Include trend analysis
      - Compare to previous periods
      - Show risk trajectory
      - Highlight changes
  medium:
  - id: RSKRPT-MED-001
    signal: Reporting frequency not defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - Ad-hoc reporting
    - No scheduled reports
    - Inconsistent reporting cadence
    explanation: |
      Defined frequency ensures consistent risk visibility. Ad-hoc
      reporting leads to gaps and inconsistency.
    remediation: |
      - Define reporting frequency
      - Schedule regular reports
      - Match frequency to risk dynamics
      - Document reporting calendar
  - id: RSKRPT-MED-002
    signal: No risk dashboards available
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reports only, no dashboards
    - No self-service access
    - Limited visualization
    explanation: |
      Dashboards enable on-demand risk visibility and effective
      visualization. Reports alone may not provide timely access.
    remediation: |
      - Implement risk dashboards
      - Enable self-service access
      - Use effective visualization
      - Update dashboards regularly
  low:
  - id: RSKRPT-LOW-001
    signal: Report distribution not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unknown who receives reports
    - No read confirmation
    - Unclear report reach
    explanation: |
      Tracking distribution ensures reports reach intended audiences
      and supports accountability for risk awareness.
    remediation: |
      - Track report distribution
      - Define distribution lists
      - Confirm receipt
      - Follow up on non-receipt
  positive:
  - id: RSKRPT-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive risk reporting program
    evidence_indicators:
    - Regular board reporting
    - Audience-appropriate content
    - Trend analysis included
  - id: RSKRPT-POS-002
    signal: Effective risk visualization
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dashboards available
    - Clear visualizations
    - Self-service access
