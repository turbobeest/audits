  what: |
    This audit examines Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) practices:
    - KRI definition and selection methodology
    - Coverage of KRIs across risk portfolio
    - Threshold definition for KRI alerts
    - Data collection and measurement processes
    - KRI reporting and dashboards
    - Predictive value of KRIs
    - KRI review and refinement
  why_it_matters: |
    KRIs provide early warning of changing risk conditions:
    - KRIs are leading indicators that signal potential risk issues
    - Enable proactive response before risks materialize
    - COSO ERM emphasizes metrics for risk monitoring
    - Well-designed KRIs correlate with actual risk levels
    - Without KRIs, organizations react to events rather than signals
    - KRI thresholds enable automated alerting
    - Boards and executives increasingly expect KRI reporting
  when_to_run:
  - Annual risk monitoring review
  - When implementing KRI program
  - After significant risk events
  - During risk reporting enhancement
  - When KRIs fail to predict events

signals:
  critical:
  - id: KRI-CRIT-001
    signal: No Key Risk Indicators defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No KRI program
    - No risk metrics tracked
    - No early warning indicators
    explanation: |
      Without KRIs, organizations lack early warning of changing risk
      conditions. They can only react to events after they occur,
      missing opportunities for proactive intervention.
    remediation: |
      - Establish KRI program
      - Define KRIs for top risks
      - Set thresholds and alerts
      - Implement measurement and reporting
  - id: KRI-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical risks have no associated KRIs
    evidence_indicators:
    - High-priority risks without indicators
    - KRI coverage gaps
    - Selective KRI implementation
    explanation: |
      Critical risks require KRIs to provide early warning. Gaps in
      KRI coverage for critical risks leave blind spots.
    remediation: |
      - Map KRIs to critical risks
      - Ensure coverage for top risks
      - Identify appropriate indicators
      - Close coverage gaps
  high:
  - id: KRI-HIGH-001
    signal: KRI thresholds not defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - KRIs measured but no thresholds
    - No alert triggers
    - Unclear what values require action
    explanation: |
      Thresholds turn measurements into actionable intelligence.
      Without thresholds, KRIs are data without decision support.
    remediation: |
      - Define thresholds for all KRIs
      - Set green/yellow/red ranges
      - Configure automated alerts
      - Document threshold rationale
  - id: KRI-HIGH-002
    signal: KRIs not predictive of risk events
    evidence_indicators:
    - KRIs did not signal known incidents
    - Lagging rather than leading indicators
    - No correlation with risk levels
    explanation: |
      KRIs should provide early warning. If they do not predict
      actual risk events, they are not serving their purpose.
    remediation: |
      - Validate KRI predictive value
      - Select leading indicators
      - Correlate KRIs with incidents
      - Replace ineffective KRIs
  medium:
  - id: KRI-MED-001
    signal: KRI data collection inconsistent
    evidence_indicators:
    - Gaps in KRI data
    - Inconsistent measurement
    - Manual collection with delays
    explanation: |
      Consistent data collection ensures KRIs are reliable and timely.
      Inconsistent data undermines confidence in KRI signals.
    remediation: |
      - Automate KRI data collection
      - Define measurement standards
      - Ensure data consistency
      - Track data quality
  - id: KRI-MED-002
    signal: KRIs not reviewed for relevance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Stale KRI definitions
    - No review of KRI effectiveness
    - KRIs unchanged despite context changes
    explanation: |
      KRI relevance should be reviewed periodically to ensure they
      remain appropriate as the risk landscape evolves.
    remediation: |
      - Schedule regular KRI reviews
      - Assess KRI effectiveness
      - Update KRIs as needed
      - Remove obsolete KRIs
  low:
  - id: KRI-LOW-001
    signal: KRIs not reported to leadership
    evidence_indicators:
    - Limited KRI visibility
    - No executive KRI reporting
    - KRIs siloed in risk team
    explanation: |
      KRIs support executive decision-making and oversight. Reporting
      to leadership enables risk-informed governance.
    remediation: |
      - Include KRIs in executive reporting
      - Create leadership dashboards
      - Report threshold breaches
      - Enable risk oversight
  positive:
  - id: KRI-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive KRI program
    evidence_indicators:
    - KRIs defined for key risks
    - Thresholds and alerts configured
    - Regular measurement and reporting
  - id: KRI-POS-002
    signal: Effective predictive KRIs
    evidence_indicators:
    - KRIs correlate with risk levels
    - Early warning value demonstrated
    - Regular KRI refinement
