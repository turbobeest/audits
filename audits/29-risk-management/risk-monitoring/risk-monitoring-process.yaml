  what: |
    This audit examines the ongoing risk monitoring process:
    - Continuous vs. periodic monitoring approaches
    - Monitoring coverage across risk portfolio
    - Automation of monitoring activities
    - Integration with other monitoring systems
    - Monitoring roles and responsibilities
    - Documentation of monitoring findings
    - Feedback loops from monitoring to risk management
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective risk monitoring ensures risk management remains current:
    - ISO 31000 requires ongoing monitoring and review of risk
    - Risk conditions change continuously; static assessments become stale
    - Monitoring detects changes requiring risk reassessment
    - NIST emphasizes continuous monitoring for security risks
    - Without monitoring, organizations are blind to emerging issues
    - Proactive monitoring enables early intervention
    - Monitoring validates that treatments remain effective
  when_to_run:
  - Annual risk management program review
  - When implementing monitoring capabilities
  - During internal audit assessments
  - After significant monitoring failures
  - When evaluating monitoring tools

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RSKMNT-CRIT-001
    signal: No risk monitoring process exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented monitoring process
    - Risks not reviewed between assessments
    - No ongoing visibility into risk levels
    explanation: |
      Without monitoring, risk management is point-in-time rather than
      ongoing. ISO 31000 requires monitoring and review as part of the
      risk management process.
    remediation: |
      - Establish risk monitoring process
      - Define monitoring frequency and approach
      - Assign monitoring responsibilities
      - Implement monitoring automation where possible
  - id: RSKMNT-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical risks not monitored
    evidence_indicators:
    - High-priority risks without monitoring
    - Selective monitoring only
    - Critical areas not covered
    explanation: |
      Critical risks require active monitoring to detect changes
      requiring response. Unmonitored critical risks may materialize
      without warning.
    remediation: |
      - Identify critical risks requiring monitoring
      - Implement monitoring for all critical risks
      - Prioritize monitoring coverage
      - Ensure no critical gaps
  high:
  - id: RSKMNT-HIGH-001
    signal: Monitoring findings not acted upon
    evidence_indicators:
    - Monitoring generates data but no action
    - No feedback to risk management
    - Findings not escalated
    explanation: |
      Monitoring provides value only when findings trigger appropriate
      action. Data without action is monitoring theater.
    remediation: |
      - Establish action protocols for findings
      - Feed monitoring into risk reassessment
      - Escalate significant findings
      - Track response to monitoring alerts
  - id: RSKMNT-HIGH-002
    signal: Monitoring significantly delayed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long delays in monitoring data
    - Stale monitoring information
    - Cannot detect timely changes
    explanation: |
      Delayed monitoring limits response capability. For dynamic risks,
      real-time or near-real-time monitoring may be required.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce monitoring latency
      - Implement real-time monitoring for critical risks
      - Automate monitoring collection
      - Ensure timely data availability
  medium:
  - id: RSKMNT-MED-001
    signal: Monitoring not automated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Manual monitoring processes
    - Limited use of automated tools
    - Monitoring resource intensive
    explanation: |
      Automation enables consistent, scalable monitoring. Manual
      monitoring is resource-intensive and prone to gaps.
    remediation: |
      - Identify automation opportunities
      - Implement monitoring tools
      - Automate data collection and alerting
      - Focus manual effort on analysis
  - id: RSKMNT-MED-002
    signal: Monitoring roles not defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unclear monitoring responsibilities
    - No ownership of monitoring activities
    - Monitoring performed ad-hoc
    explanation: |
      Clear roles ensure monitoring is performed consistently.
      Without ownership, monitoring activities may be neglected.
    remediation: |
      - Define monitoring roles and responsibilities
      - Assign monitoring ownership
      - Include in job descriptions
      - Track monitoring performance
  low:
  - id: RSKMNT-LOW-001
    signal: Monitoring not integrated with other systems
    evidence_indicators:
    - Siloed monitoring data
    - No integration with SIEM/GRC
    - Manual data aggregation
    explanation: |
      Integration enables comprehensive visibility and efficient
      analysis. Siloed monitoring limits insight.
    remediation: |
      - Integrate with GRC platforms
      - Connect to SIEM and logging
      - Enable data aggregation
      - Create unified dashboards
  positive:
  - id: RSKMNT-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive risk monitoring program
    evidence_indicators:
    - Documented monitoring process
    - Automated monitoring in place
    - Critical risks covered
  - id: RSKMNT-POS-002
    signal: Effective monitoring feedback loop
    evidence_indicators:
    - Findings drive action
    - Integration with risk management
    - Continuous improvement
