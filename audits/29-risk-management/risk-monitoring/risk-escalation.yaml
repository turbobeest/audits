  what: |
    This audit examines risk escalation processes:
    - Escalation criteria and triggers
    - Escalation paths and channels
    - Timeliness requirements
    - Documentation of escalations
    - Authority levels for escalation decisions
    - Follow-up and resolution tracking
    - Escalation effectiveness
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective escalation ensures critical risks receive appropriate attention:
    - Risks exceeding tolerance require leadership visibility
    - COSO ERM emphasizes escalation of significant issues
    - Without escalation, critical risks may be addressed inadequately
    - Timely escalation enables rapid response
    - Escalation supports accountability and governance
    - Poor escalation leads to delayed or absent response to critical risks
    - Regulatory bodies often examine escalation effectiveness
  when_to_run:
  - Annual risk governance review
  - After escalation failures
  - When implementing escalation processes
  - During internal audit assessments
  - After significant incidents

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RSKESC-CRIT-001
    signal: No risk escalation process defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented escalation procedures
    - No escalation criteria
    - Ad-hoc escalation only
    explanation: |
      Without a defined process, escalation is inconsistent and may not
      occur when needed. Critical risks require reliable escalation
      to appropriate authorities.
    remediation: |
      - Define escalation procedures
      - Establish escalation criteria
      - Document escalation paths
      - Train staff on escalation
  - id: RSKESC-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical risks not escalated
    evidence_indicators:
    - High-risk items without escalation
    - Tolerance exceedances not reported
    - Leadership unaware of critical risks
    explanation: |
      Critical risks require executive attention. Failure to escalate
      leaves leadership uninformed and unable to direct appropriate
      response.
    remediation: |
      - Escalate all risks exceeding tolerance
      - Ensure leadership visibility of critical risks
      - Track escalation compliance
      - Investigate escalation failures
  high:
  - id: RSKESC-HIGH-001
    signal: Escalation triggers not defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No clear criteria for when to escalate
    - Subjective escalation decisions
    - Inconsistent escalation practice
    explanation: |
      Defined triggers ensure consistent escalation. Without criteria,
      escalation depends on individual judgment, leading to inconsistency.
    remediation: |
      - Define escalation triggers
      - Link to risk tolerance thresholds
      - Document trigger conditions
      - Train on trigger recognition
  - id: RSKESC-HIGH-002
    signal: Escalation significantly delayed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long delays before escalation
    - No timeliness requirements
    - Slow escalation process
    explanation: |
      Timely escalation enables rapid response. Delayed escalation
      reduces response options and increases potential impact.
    remediation: |
      - Define escalation timeliness requirements
      - Implement rapid escalation channels
      - Track escalation timing
      - Address delays promptly
  medium:
  - id: RSKESC-MED-001
    signal: Escalations not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No records of escalations
    - Cannot track escalation history
    - No audit trail
    explanation: |
      Documentation supports accountability and enables learning.
      Undocumented escalations cannot be reviewed or improved.
    remediation: |
      - Require escalation documentation
      - Track escalation records
      - Enable audit trail
      - Review escalation history
  - id: RSKESC-MED-002
    signal: Escalation follow-up not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No tracking of escalation resolution
    - Open escalations not monitored
    - No closure process
    explanation: |
      Follow-up ensures escalated items are addressed. Without tracking,
      escalations may not receive appropriate resolution.
    remediation: |
      - Track escalation resolution
      - Define closure criteria
      - Monitor open escalations
      - Report on escalation status
  low:
  - id: RSKESC-LOW-001
    signal: Escalation effectiveness not measured
    evidence_indicators:
    - No metrics on escalation
    - Unknown escalation performance
    - No improvement tracking
    explanation: |
      Measuring effectiveness enables improvement. Without metrics,
      escalation quality cannot be assessed or enhanced.
    remediation: |
      - Define escalation metrics
      - Track escalation effectiveness
      - Analyze escalation patterns
      - Drive improvement
  positive:
  - id: RSKESC-POS-001
    signal: Effective escalation process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear triggers and criteria
    - Timely escalation practice
    - Documented and tracked
  - id: RSKESC-POS-002
    signal: Escalation drives action
    evidence_indicators:
    - Escalations resolved
    - Leadership responsive
    - Effective follow-up
