  what: |
    This audit examines risk review cadence practices:
    - Scheduled review frequencies by risk type/priority
    - Adherence to review schedules
    - Review scope and depth requirements
    - Ad-hoc review triggers
    - Documentation of review outcomes
    - Integration with organizational planning cycles
    - Review effectiveness and continuous improvement
  why_it_matters: |
    Regular review ensures risk information remains accurate:
    - ISO 31000 requires periodic review of risk and its treatment
    - Stale assessments lead to poor decisions
    - Different risks require different review frequencies
    - Review cadence should match risk dynamics
    - Scheduled reviews prevent assessment drift
    - COSO ERM emphasizes ongoing risk review
    - Without regular review, the risk register becomes unreliable
  when_to_run:
  - Annual risk governance review
  - When establishing review schedules
  - After review schedule failures
  - During internal audit
  - When optimizing risk processes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RVWCAD-CRIT-001
    signal: No risk review schedule defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No scheduled reviews
    - Reviews performed ad-hoc only
    - No review calendar
    explanation: |
      Without scheduled reviews, risk information becomes stale.
      ISO 31000 requires periodic review as part of risk management.
    remediation: |
      - Establish risk review schedule
      - Define frequencies by risk type/priority
      - Create review calendar
      - Assign review responsibilities
  - id: RVWCAD-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical risks not reviewed for extended periods
    evidence_indicators:
    - High-priority risks not reviewed in 12+ months
    - Review overdue for critical items
    - Stale critical risk assessments
    explanation: |
      Critical risks require more frequent review. Extended periods
      without review may mean assessments no longer reflect reality.
    remediation: |
      - Review critical risks immediately
      - Establish more frequent cadence for critical risks
      - Track and enforce review compliance
      - Prioritize overdue reviews
  high:
  - id: RVWCAD-HIGH-001
    signal: Review schedule not followed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Low review completion rate
    - Many overdue reviews
    - Schedule exists but not enforced
    explanation: |
      A schedule is only valuable if followed. Non-compliance undermines
      the purpose of scheduled reviews.
    remediation: |
      - Track review compliance
      - Escalate overdue reviews
      - Address barriers to completion
      - Enforce accountability
  - id: RVWCAD-HIGH-002
    signal: Review frequency does not match risk dynamics
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same frequency for all risks
    - Static risks reviewed too often
    - Dynamic risks reviewed too rarely
    explanation: |
      Review frequency should reflect how quickly risk conditions change.
      Uniform frequency wastes resources or creates gaps.
    remediation: |
      - Differentiate frequency by risk characteristics
      - Review dynamic risks more frequently
      - Reduce frequency for stable risks
      - Match cadence to risk dynamics
  medium:
  - id: RVWCAD-MED-001
    signal: No ad-hoc review triggers defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only scheduled reviews
    - No event-driven reassessment
    - Changes don't trigger review
    explanation: |
      Significant events should trigger ad-hoc review. Relying only
      on scheduled reviews may miss important changes.
    remediation: |
      - Define ad-hoc review triggers
      - Link to events and changes
      - Implement trigger monitoring
      - Document trigger-driven reviews
  - id: RVWCAD-MED-002
    signal: Review outcomes not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No record of review findings
    - Cannot track assessment changes
    - Review history unavailable
    explanation: |
      Documented outcomes enable tracking changes and supporting
      audit requirements.
    remediation: |
      - Document all review outcomes
      - Track changes from reviews
      - Maintain review history
      - Enable audit trail
  low:
  - id: RVWCAD-LOW-001
    signal: Review effectiveness not assessed
    evidence_indicators:
    - No metrics on review quality
    - Unknown review value
    - No improvement tracking
    explanation: |
      Assessing effectiveness enables improvement in review processes.
    remediation: |
      - Measure review effectiveness
      - Assess quality of reviews
      - Identify improvement opportunities
      - Track review value
  positive:
  - id: RVWCAD-POS-001
    signal: Effective review cadence management
    evidence_indicators:
    - Defined schedules followed
    - Frequencies match risk dynamics
    - Outcomes documented
  - id: RVWCAD-POS-002
    signal: Comprehensive review approach
    evidence_indicators:
    - Scheduled and ad-hoc reviews
    - Integrated with planning
    - Continuous improvement
