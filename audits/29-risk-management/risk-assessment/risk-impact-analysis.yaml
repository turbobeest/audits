  what: |
    This audit examines how the organization analyzes risk impact:
    - Impact scale definitions and dimensions
    - Multiple impact categories (financial, operational, reputational, etc.)
    - Methods for estimating consequence severity
    - Cascading and secondary impact consideration
    - Consistency of impact assessments
    - Documentation and rationale for impact ratings
    - Alignment of impact criteria with organizational objectives
  why_it_matters: |
    Accurate impact analysis is essential for appropriate risk response:
    - Impact assessment drives resource allocation for risk treatment
    - ISO 31000 requires analysis of consequences in risk assessment
    - Underestimating impact leads to inadequate controls
    - Overestimating impact wastes resources on low-impact risks
    - FAIR methodology emphasizes rigorous loss magnitude analysis
    - Multi-dimensional impact ensures comprehensive consequence view
    - Regulatory compliance often requires documented impact analysis
  when_to_run:
  - Annual risk management program review
  - When implementing or revising risk methodology
  - During business impact analysis
  - After significant incidents reveal impact gaps
  - When organizational risk tolerance changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: IMPCT-CRIT-001
    signal: No defined impact scale
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented impact scale
    - Assessors use different scales
    - No criteria for impact levels
    explanation: |
      A defined impact scale is fundamental to risk assessment. Without it,
      impact assessments are subjective and non-comparable. ISO 31000 requires
      defined criteria for analyzing consequences.
    remediation: |
      - Define standard impact scale (e.g., 5-point scale)
      - Document clear criteria for each level
      - Include quantitative ranges where possible
      - Provide examples for calibration
  - id: IMPCT-CRIT-002
    signal: Single-dimension impact assessment only
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only financial impact considered
    - No operational impact analysis
    - Reputational and regulatory impacts ignored
    explanation: |
      Risks have multiple impact dimensions. Analyzing only one dimension
      (typically financial) misses significant consequences and leads to
      incomplete risk prioritization.
    remediation: |
      - Define multiple impact dimensions
      - Include financial, operational, reputational, regulatory
      - Assess all dimensions for each risk
      - Use highest dimension for overall rating or aggregation
  high:
  - id: IMPCT-HIGH-001
    signal: Impact scale poorly calibrated to organization
    evidence_indicators:
    - Generic scale not aligned to business context
    - Financial thresholds inappropriate for organization size
    - Impact levels do not match risk appetite
    explanation: |
      Impact scales must be calibrated to the organization's context and
      risk appetite. Generic scales may under- or over-state consequences
      relative to organizational tolerance.
    remediation: |
      - Align impact thresholds with organizational scale
      - Map impact levels to risk appetite statements
      - Define quantitative criteria appropriate to context
      - Validate calibration with leadership
  - id: IMPCT-HIGH-002
    signal: Cascading impacts not considered
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only direct impacts assessed
    - No secondary effect analysis
    - Interdependencies not reflected
    explanation: |
      Risks often have cascading effects beyond the immediate impact.
      Secondary impacts can exceed primary impacts. Analysis must consider
      knock-on effects.
    remediation: |
      - Require cascading impact analysis
      - Consider secondary and tertiary effects
      - Map risk interdependencies
      - Include supply chain and customer impacts
  medium:
  - id: IMPCT-MED-001
    signal: Impact not linked to business objectives
    evidence_indicators:
    - Impact defined in isolation
    - No connection to strategic goals
    - Unclear what impact means for the business
    explanation: |
      Impact should be understood in terms of effects on business objectives.
      This connection ensures risk prioritization aligns with what matters
      to the organization.
    remediation: |
      - Link impact definitions to business objectives
      - Define impact in terms of goal achievement
      - Align impact categories with strategic priorities
      - Validate impact framing with leadership
  - id: IMPCT-MED-002
    signal: Impact duration not considered
    evidence_indicators:
    - No distinction between temporary and permanent impacts
    - Recovery time not factored
    - Duration amplification not assessed
    explanation: |
      Impact severity is influenced by duration. A temporary disruption
      differs significantly from permanent damage. Duration should factor
      into impact assessment.
    remediation: |
      - Include duration in impact assessment
      - Consider recovery time in ratings
      - Distinguish temporary from permanent impacts
      - Factor in cumulative effects over time
  low:
  - id: IMPCT-LOW-001
    signal: Impact rationale not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only rating recorded
    - No explanation of impact basis
    - Unable to validate assessments
    explanation: |
      Documented rationale supports review and validation of assessments.
      It also enables learning and improvement of estimation practices.
    remediation: |
      - Require rationale documentation
      - Document assumptions and data sources
      - Enable audit trail of assessment basis
      - Review rationale quality periodically
  positive:
  - id: IMPCT-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive multi-dimensional impact analysis
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple impact dimensions assessed
    - Cascading impacts considered
    - Calibrated to organizational context
  - id: IMPCT-POS-002
    signal: Impact aligned with business objectives
    evidence_indicators:
    - Impact linked to strategic goals
    - Leadership-validated thresholds
    - Well-documented rationale
