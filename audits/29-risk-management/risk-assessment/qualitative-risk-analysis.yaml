  what: |
    This audit examines qualitative risk analysis practices:
    - Use of categorical scales (High/Medium/Low)
    - Expert judgment elicitation techniques
    - Risk matrix and heat map approaches
    - Consistency and calibration of qualitative assessments
    - Documentation of qualitative rationale
    - Bias mitigation in subjective assessments
    - Appropriate use of qualitative vs. quantitative methods
  why_it_matters: |
    Qualitative risk analysis is the most common assessment approach:
    - Most organizations rely primarily on qualitative methods
    - ISO 31000 includes qualitative analysis as a valid approach
    - Qualitative assessment enables rapid screening and prioritization
    - However, qualitative methods are prone to bias and inconsistency
    - Well-structured qualitative analysis can be highly effective
    - Poor qualitative practices lead to unreliable risk prioritization
    - Understanding limitations enables appropriate method selection
  when_to_run:
  - Annual risk methodology review
  - When assessing qualitative assessment quality
  - During assessor training program development
  - After identifying assessment inconsistencies
  - When considering adding quantitative methods

signals:
  critical:
  - id: QUALR-CRIT-001
    signal: No defined criteria for qualitative categories
    evidence_indicators:
    - No definitions for High/Medium/Low
    - Categories interpreted differently
    - No guidance for assessors
    explanation: |
      Without defined criteria, qualitative categories are meaningless.
      Different assessors will interpret "High" differently, making
      assessments incomparable and prioritization unreliable.
    remediation: |
      - Define clear criteria for each category
      - Provide examples for each level
      - Document what constitutes each rating
      - Train assessors on criteria application
  - id: QUALR-CRIT-002
    signal: Qualitative assessments completely uncalibrated
    evidence_indicators:
    - No consistency across assessors
    - No validation of assessments
    - No benchmarking or comparison
    explanation: |
      Uncalibrated qualitative assessments are unreliable. Research shows
      that uncalibrated expert estimates can vary by orders of magnitude.
      Calibration ensures meaningful and consistent assessments.
    remediation: |
      - Implement calibration training
      - Use structured elicitation techniques
      - Validate assessments through comparison
      - Benchmark against historical outcomes
  high:
  - id: QUALR-HIGH-001
    signal: Known biases not mitigated
    evidence_indicators:
    - No recognition of assessment biases
    - Single assessor for each risk
    - Anchoring and availability effects visible
    explanation: |
      Qualitative assessments are susceptible to cognitive biases including
      anchoring, availability, overconfidence, and groupthink. Without
      mitigation, these biases systematically distort risk assessments.
    remediation: |
      - Train assessors on cognitive biases
      - Use multiple assessors per risk
      - Apply structured elicitation methods
      - Implement bias checks in review
  - id: QUALR-HIGH-002
    signal: Risk matrix design creates blind spots
    evidence_indicators:
    - Equal weight to all cells
    - High-impact/low-probability underweighted
    - Range compression in assessments
    explanation: |
      Risk matrix design affects prioritization outcomes. Common issues
      include underweighting rare but catastrophic risks and creating
      meaningless distinctions between adjacent cells.
    remediation: |
      - Review matrix design for blind spots
      - Consider asymmetric weighting for severity
      - Validate that matrix reflects risk appetite
      - Test matrix against known risk scenarios
  medium:
  - id: QUALR-MED-001
    signal: Rationale for assessments not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only ratings recorded
    - No explanation of reasoning
    - Unable to validate assessments
    explanation: |
      Documented rationale supports validation and learning. Without it,
      assessments cannot be reviewed or improved over time.
    remediation: |
      - Require rationale for all assessments
      - Document key factors considered
      - Enable review and validation
      - Use rationale for calibration
  - id: QUALR-MED-002
    signal: Qualitative used where quantitative appropriate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Financial risks assessed qualitatively only
    - Data available but not used
    - All risks treated with same method
    explanation: |
      Some risks warrant quantitative analysis, particularly when data
      exists and financial precision matters. Using qualitative methods
      when quantitative is appropriate limits decision quality.
    remediation: |
      - Assess which risks need quantitative analysis
      - Use quantitative for financial risks where possible
      - Apply FAIR or other quantitative methods
      - Integrate qualitative and quantitative results
  low:
  - id: QUALR-LOW-001
    signal: Risk matrix not used for communication
    evidence_indicators:
    - Matrix exists but not visualized
    - Heat maps not generated
    - No visual risk communication
    explanation: |
      Risk matrices and heat maps are valuable communication tools.
      Effective visualization helps stakeholders understand risk portfolios.
    remediation: |
      - Generate risk heat maps
      - Use in executive reporting
      - Track changes over time visually
      - Make visualizations accessible
  positive:
  - id: QUALR-POS-001
    signal: Well-calibrated qualitative methodology
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear criteria defined
    - Assessor training and calibration
    - Consistent application
  - id: QUALR-POS-002
    signal: Bias-aware assessment process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple assessors used
    - Structured elicitation
    - Bias mitigation techniques applied
