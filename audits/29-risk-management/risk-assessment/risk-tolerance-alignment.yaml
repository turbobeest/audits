  what: |
    This audit examines alignment between risk assessments and tolerance:
    - Risk appetite and tolerance statement documentation
    - Translation of appetite into measurable thresholds
    - Consistent application of tolerance in assessments
    - Escalation when risks exceed tolerance
    - Board and executive involvement in appetite setting
    - Regular review and update of tolerance levels
    - Communication of appetite across the organization
  why_it_matters: |
    Risk tolerance alignment ensures risk management serves business strategy:
    - Risk appetite defines how much risk the organization is willing to accept
    - ISO 31000 requires establishing risk criteria including appetite
    - COSO ERM emphasizes alignment of risk with strategy and performance
    - Without clear tolerance, risk treatment decisions are arbitrary
    - Risks exceeding tolerance require immediate escalation and action
    - Appetite that is too conservative stifles innovation
    - Appetite that is too aggressive creates unacceptable exposure
  when_to_run:
  - Annual strategic planning and risk review
  - When revising risk appetite statements
  - After board or leadership changes
  - Following significant risk events
  - During internal audit assessments

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RTOL-CRIT-001
    signal: No risk appetite or tolerance defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No risk appetite statement
    - No tolerance thresholds
    - No guidance on acceptable risk
    explanation: |
      Risk appetite is fundamental to effective risk management. Without it,
      risk treatment decisions lack context. ISO 31000 requires establishing
      risk criteria including appetite. COSO ERM emphasizes appetite as
      a core ERM concept.
    remediation: |
      - Develop risk appetite statement with board involvement
      - Define tolerance levels for different risk categories
      - Translate appetite into measurable thresholds
      - Communicate appetite across the organization
  - id: RTOL-CRIT-002
    signal: Risks exceeding tolerance not escalated
    evidence_indicators:
    - No escalation process for tolerance exceedances
    - High risks not flagged for leadership
    - Tolerance breaches not tracked
    explanation: |
      Risks exceeding tolerance require immediate escalation and action.
      Without escalation, the organization knowingly accepts unacceptable
      risk levels without appropriate oversight.
    remediation: |
      - Define escalation procedures for tolerance exceedances
      - Implement automatic flagging in risk tools
      - Track and report tolerance breaches
      - Ensure leadership visibility and response
  high:
  - id: RTOL-HIGH-001
    signal: Risk appetite not translatable to assessments
    evidence_indicators:
    - Appetite stated in vague terms
    - No quantifiable thresholds
    - Cannot compare risks to appetite
    explanation: |
      Risk appetite must be translated into measurable criteria that can be
      compared to risk assessments. Vague appetite statements provide no
      practical guidance.
    remediation: |
      - Translate appetite into specific thresholds
      - Define tolerance by risk category
      - Ensure assessments can be compared to thresholds
      - Provide clear guidance for assessors
  - id: RTOL-HIGH-002
    signal: Board/executive not involved in appetite setting
    evidence_indicators:
    - No board approval of appetite
    - Risk team sets appetite alone
    - No leadership ownership of tolerance
    explanation: |
      Risk appetite is a strategic decision that requires board and executive
      involvement. It reflects the organization's willingness to accept risk
      in pursuit of objectives.
    remediation: |
      - Involve board in appetite development
      - Obtain executive approval for tolerance levels
      - Document leadership ownership
      - Review appetite at board level periodically
  medium:
  - id: RTOL-MED-001
    signal: Appetite not differentiated by risk type
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single appetite for all risks
    - No category-specific tolerances
    - Same threshold for financial and safety risks
    explanation: |
      Organizations typically have different appetites for different risk
      types. Safety and compliance risks may have near-zero tolerance
      while strategic risks may have higher appetite.
    remediation: |
      - Differentiate appetite by risk category
      - Set appropriate tolerance for each type
      - Document rationale for different levels
      - Communicate category-specific tolerances
  - id: RTOL-MED-002
    signal: Appetite not reviewed regularly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Stale appetite statements
    - No scheduled review
    - Unchanged despite strategy shifts
    explanation: |
      Risk appetite should evolve with strategy and context. Regular review
      ensures appetite remains aligned with organizational objectives and
      external conditions.
    remediation: |
      - Schedule annual appetite review
      - Review when strategy changes
      - Update tolerance as appropriate
      - Document review and decisions
  low:
  - id: RTOL-LOW-001
    signal: Appetite not communicated broadly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Limited awareness of appetite
    - Business units unaware of tolerances
    - No appetite training
    explanation: |
      Risk appetite must be communicated to be effective. Broad awareness
      enables risk-informed decision-making throughout the organization.
    remediation: |
      - Communicate appetite organization-wide
      - Include in risk training
      - Make appetite accessible and understandable
      - Reinforce in risk communications
  positive:
  - id: RTOL-POS-001
    signal: Well-defined risk appetite with clear thresholds
    evidence_indicators:
    - Board-approved appetite statement
    - Category-specific tolerances
    - Measurable thresholds
  - id: RTOL-POS-002
    signal: Effective appetite-assessment alignment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Assessments compared to thresholds
    - Exceedances escalated
    - Regular appetite review
