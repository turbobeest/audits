  what: |
    This audit examines how the organization assesses risk likelihood:
    - Likelihood scale definitions and calibration
    - Methods for estimating probability (qualitative and quantitative)
    - Use of historical data in likelihood estimation
    - Consistency of likelihood assessments across assessors
    - Documentation and rationale for likelihood ratings
    - Consideration of threat landscape and vulnerability exposure
    - Time horizon for likelihood assessments
  why_it_matters: |
    Accurate likelihood assessment is essential for effective risk prioritization:
    - Risk = Likelihood x Impact; inaccurate likelihood skews prioritization
    - ISO 31000 requires analysis of likelihood in risk assessment
    - Underestimating likelihood leads to unaddressed high-risk items
    - Overestimating likelihood wastes resources on low-probability risks
    - FAIR methodology emphasizes rigorous probability analysis
    - Consistent likelihood assessment enables meaningful risk comparisons
    - Regulatory frameworks often require documented likelihood analysis
  when_to_run:
  - Annual risk management program review
  - When implementing or revising risk methodology
  - During internal audit assessments
  - After identifying calibration issues in assessments
  - When training new risk assessors

signals:
  critical:
  - id: LIKHD-CRIT-001
    signal: No defined likelihood scale
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented likelihood scale
    - Assessors use different scales
    - No guidance for likelihood ratings
    explanation: |
      A defined likelihood scale is fundamental to risk assessment. Without
      it, assessments are subjective and non-comparable. ISO 31000 and NIST
      800-30 require defined criteria for analyzing likelihood.
    remediation: |
      - Define standard likelihood scale (e.g., 5-point scale)
      - Document clear criteria for each level
      - Provide examples and calibration guidance
      - Train all assessors on the scale
  - id: LIKHD-CRIT-002
    signal: Likelihood assessments completely subjective
    evidence_indicators:
    - No data used in likelihood estimation
    - No documented rationale for ratings
    - Wide variation between assessors
    explanation: |
      Purely subjective likelihood assessment is unreliable. Research shows
      that uncalibrated estimates vary widely. Using data and structured
      methods improves accuracy.
    remediation: |
      - Incorporate historical data in likelihood analysis
      - Document rationale for likelihood ratings
      - Use structured estimation techniques
      - Implement calibration training for assessors
  high:
  - id: LIKHD-HIGH-001
    signal: Likelihood scale poorly calibrated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Scale levels not clearly differentiated
    - No quantitative ranges provided
    - Assessors interpret scale differently
    explanation: |
      Calibration ensures that different assessors apply the scale consistently.
      Poorly calibrated scales lead to inconsistent risk prioritization.
    remediation: |
      - Define quantitative ranges for each level
      - Provide reference examples for each level
      - Conduct calibration exercises
      - Review for consistency across assessors
  - id: LIKHD-HIGH-002
    signal: Historical data not used in likelihood assessment
    evidence_indicators:
    - No reference to past incidents
    - Industry data not considered
    - Threat intelligence not integrated
    explanation: |
      Historical data grounds likelihood assessments in reality. Incident
      history, industry data, and threat intelligence provide evidence-based
      inputs for probability estimation.
    remediation: |
      - Incorporate incident history in assessments
      - Reference industry data and benchmarks
      - Integrate threat intelligence sources
      - Track actual vs. estimated likelihood over time
  medium:
  - id: LIKHD-MED-001
    signal: Time horizon for likelihood not specified
    evidence_indicators:
    - Likelihood without time context
    - No annual vs. multi-year distinction
    - Inconsistent time frames in assessments
    explanation: |
      Likelihood must be specified relative to a time horizon. A 1% annual
      probability is very different from a 1% monthly probability. Clear
      time frames enable meaningful comparisons.
    remediation: |
      - Define standard time horizon (typically annual)
      - Document time horizon in methodology
      - Ensure consistent application
      - Convert rates to standard time frame
  - id: LIKHD-MED-002
    signal: Likelihood not reassessed when conditions change
    evidence_indicators:
    - Static likelihood ratings
    - No updates after threat changes
    - No review triggers defined
    explanation: |
      Likelihood can change with the threat landscape, new vulnerabilities,
      or control changes. Static assessments become inaccurate over time.
    remediation: |
      - Define triggers for likelihood reassessment
      - Review likelihood when conditions change
      - Update after new threats or vulnerabilities
      - Schedule periodic reassessment
  low:
  - id: LIKHD-LOW-001
    signal: Likelihood rationale not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only rating recorded, no explanation
    - Unable to understand basis for assessment
    - No supporting evidence referenced
    explanation: |
      Documented rationale supports review and validation of assessments.
      It also enables learning and improvement of estimation practices.
    remediation: |
      - Require rationale documentation for all ratings
      - Reference evidence and data sources
      - Enable audit trail of assessment basis
      - Review rationale quality periodically
  positive:
  - id: LIKHD-POS-001
    signal: Well-calibrated likelihood assessment methodology
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear scale with quantitative ranges
    - Documented criteria and examples
    - Consistent application across assessors
  - id: LIKHD-POS-002
    signal: Data-driven likelihood assessment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Historical data incorporated
    - Threat intelligence integrated
    - Rationale documented for ratings
