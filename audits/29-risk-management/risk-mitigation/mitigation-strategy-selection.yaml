  what: |
    This audit examines how risk mitigation strategies are selected:
    - Understanding of available strategy options (4Ts: Treat, Transfer, Tolerate, Terminate)
    - Criteria for selecting appropriate strategies
    - Cost-benefit analysis of mitigation options
    - Alignment with risk appetite and organizational objectives
    - Consideration of resource constraints
    - Documentation of strategy selection rationale
    - Review and approval of selected strategies
  why_it_matters: |
    Appropriate strategy selection optimizes risk management effectiveness:
    - Not all risks should be treated the same way
    - ISO 31000 requires selection of appropriate risk treatment options
    - Incorrect strategy selection wastes resources or leaves risks unaddressed
    - Cost-benefit analysis ensures efficient resource allocation
    - NIST emphasizes selecting responses that address risk appropriately
    - Some risks should be avoided, others transferred, accepted, or reduced
    - Strategy alignment with objectives ensures business value
  when_to_run:
  - After risk assessment completion
  - Annual risk treatment planning
  - When evaluating risk treatment options
  - During budget and resource allocation
  - After significant risk events

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MITSTRAT-CRIT-001
    signal: No risk treatment strategy documentation
    evidence_indicators:
    - No treatment strategies assigned to risks
    - No selection criteria documented
    - Ad-hoc treatment decisions
    explanation: |
      Without documented strategies, risk treatment is reactive and
      inconsistent. ISO 31000 requires selecting and implementing risk
      treatment options based on defined criteria.
    remediation: |
      - Define available treatment strategies (4Ts)
      - Establish selection criteria
      - Assign strategies to all significant risks
      - Document rationale for selections
  - id: MITSTRAT-CRIT-002
    signal: All risks treated with single strategy
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only mitigation considered
    - No use of transfer, avoidance, or acceptance
    - One-size-fits-all approach
    explanation: |
      Different risks warrant different strategies. Using only one approach
      (typically mitigation) ignores more appropriate options and wastes
      resources.
    remediation: |
      - Consider all strategy options for each risk
      - Use transfer for insurable risks
      - Accept risks within tolerance
      - Avoid risks that exceed appetite without viable treatment
  high:
  - id: MITSTRAT-HIGH-001
    signal: No cost-benefit analysis for strategies
    evidence_indicators:
    - Strategies selected without cost analysis
    - No comparison of treatment costs to risk reduction
    - Resource allocation not risk-based
    explanation: |
      Cost-benefit analysis ensures efficient resource allocation. Without
      it, organizations may spend more on treatment than the risk warrants
      or under-invest in critical areas.
    remediation: |
      - Conduct cost-benefit analysis for treatments
      - Compare treatment cost to risk reduction value
      - Prioritize high-value treatments
      - Document analysis and decisions
  - id: MITSTRAT-HIGH-002
    signal: Strategy selection not aligned with appetite
    evidence_indicators:
    - Strategies that don't reduce risk to tolerance
    - No reference to appetite in selection
    - Accepted risks exceed tolerance
    explanation: |
      Strategy selection should target bringing risks within tolerance.
      Selecting strategies without appetite reference may leave risks
      above acceptable levels.
    remediation: |
      - Consider appetite in strategy selection
      - Ensure selected strategy achieves acceptable risk level
      - Document expected residual risk
      - Verify alignment with tolerance
  medium:
  - id: MITSTRAT-MED-001
    signal: Strategy selection rationale not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only strategy recorded, not reasoning
    - Unable to explain why strategy chosen
    - No audit trail for decisions
    explanation: |
      Documented rationale supports review and learning. It also
      demonstrates due diligence in risk treatment decisions.
    remediation: |
      - Require documented rationale for all strategies
      - Explain why selected strategy is appropriate
      - Reference cost-benefit and appetite considerations
      - Enable audit trail
  - id: MITSTRAT-MED-002
    signal: Strategy selection not approved
    evidence_indicators:
    - No approval process for strategies
    - Risk team selects without oversight
    - No risk owner sign-off
    explanation: |
      Strategy selection has resource and risk implications requiring
      appropriate approval. Risk owners should approve treatment
      approaches for their risks.
    remediation: |
      - Establish approval process for strategies
      - Require risk owner sign-off
      - Document approvals
      - Escalate significant strategy decisions
  low:
  - id: MITSTRAT-LOW-001
    signal: Strategy options not communicated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Limited awareness of strategy options
    - Only mitigation understood
    - No training on strategy selection
    explanation: |
      Broad understanding of strategy options enables better decisions.
      Limited awareness leads to defaulting to familiar approaches.
    remediation: |
      - Train staff on strategy options
      - Communicate selection criteria
      - Provide examples of each strategy
      - Enable informed decisions
  positive:
  - id: MITSTRAT-POS-001
    signal: Effective multi-strategy approach
    evidence_indicators:
    - All strategy types used appropriately
    - Cost-benefit analysis conducted
    - Aligned with appetite
  - id: MITSTRAT-POS-002
    signal: Well-documented strategy selection
    evidence_indicators:
    - Rationale documented
    - Approvals in place
    - Audit trail complete
