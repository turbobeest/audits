  what: |
    This audit examines risk acceptance criteria and processes:
    - Defined criteria for when acceptance is appropriate
    - Authority levels for accepting different risk levels
    - Formal acceptance documentation requirements
    - Alignment with risk appetite and tolerance
    - Time-bound vs. permanent acceptance
    - Acceptance review and renewal processes
    - Communication of accepted risks
  why_it_matters: |
    Risk acceptance requires formal governance and documentation:
    - Not all risks can or should be treated; some must be accepted
    - ISO 31000 includes risk acceptance as a valid treatment option
    - Without criteria, acceptance becomes a default rather than a decision
    - Authority levels ensure appropriate oversight for different risks
    - Documented acceptance provides accountability and audit trail
    - Time-bound acceptance ensures periodic reconsideration
    - Regulatory compliance may require demonstrated acceptance decisions
  when_to_run:
  - During risk treatment planning
  - Annual acceptance review
  - When establishing risk governance
  - During compliance audits
  - After risk appetite changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RISKAC-CRIT-001
    signal: No risk acceptance criteria defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented acceptance criteria
    - Acceptance decisions ad-hoc
    - No guidance for when acceptance appropriate
    explanation: |
      Without defined criteria, risk acceptance becomes arbitrary.
      Criteria ensure acceptance is deliberate and appropriate, not
      a default when treatment seems difficult.
    remediation: |
      - Define risk acceptance criteria
      - Align criteria with risk appetite
      - Document conditions for acceptance
      - Communicate criteria to stakeholders
  - id: RISKAC-CRIT-002
    signal: Risks accepted without appropriate authority
    evidence_indicators:
    - No authority matrix for acceptance
    - Junior staff accepting significant risks
    - No escalation for high-risk acceptance
    explanation: |
      Different risk levels require different authority levels for
      acceptance. Significant risks accepted without appropriate
      authority lack proper oversight.
    remediation: |
      - Define authority matrix for acceptance
      - Match authority to risk level
      - Require escalation for significant risks
      - Document authority delegation
  high:
  - id: RISKAC-HIGH-001
    signal: Risk acceptance not documented
    evidence_indicators:
    - No acceptance records
    - Verbal acceptance only
    - Cannot demonstrate acceptance decisions
    explanation: |
      Documented acceptance provides accountability and audit trail.
      Without documentation, organizations cannot demonstrate due
      diligence in risk decisions.
    remediation: |
      - Require formal acceptance documentation
      - Include rationale and authority
      - Maintain acceptance records
      - Enable audit trail
  - id: RISKAC-HIGH-002
    signal: Acceptance above tolerance without escalation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Accepted risks exceed tolerance
    - No board/executive visibility
    - Above-tolerance acceptance routine
    explanation: |
      Risks accepted above tolerance represent deliberate operation
      outside defined limits. This requires highest-level visibility
      and approval.
    remediation: |
      - Require executive approval above tolerance
      - Escalate to board for significant acceptances
      - Document exceptional approval clearly
      - Time-limit above-tolerance acceptance
  medium:
  - id: RISKAC-MED-001
    signal: Acceptance not time-bound
    evidence_indicators:
    - Permanent acceptance without review
    - No expiration on acceptances
    - Stale acceptances not reconsidered
    explanation: |
      Time-bound acceptance ensures periodic reconsideration. Permanent
      acceptance may become inappropriate as conditions change.
    remediation: |
      - Implement time-bound acceptance
      - Require periodic renewal
      - Review conditions at expiration
      - Document acceptance duration
  - id: RISKAC-MED-002
    signal: Accepted risks not monitored
    evidence_indicators:
    - Accept and forget approach
    - No monitoring of accepted risks
    - Changes not triggering review
    explanation: |
      Accepted risks should be monitored for condition changes that
      might affect the acceptance decision. Monitoring ensures continued
      appropriateness.
    remediation: |
      - Monitor accepted risks
      - Define review triggers
      - Track conditions affecting acceptance
      - Reassess when conditions change
  low:
  - id: RISKAC-LOW-001
    signal: Accepted risks not communicated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Limited visibility of acceptances
    - Stakeholders unaware of accepted risks
    - No acceptance reporting
    explanation: |
      Communication of accepted risks ensures organizational awareness
      of known exposures and enables appropriate planning.
    remediation: |
      - Communicate accepted risks
      - Include in risk reporting
      - Inform affected stakeholders
      - Enable informed decisions
  positive:
  - id: RISKAC-POS-001
    signal: Robust acceptance governance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clear criteria defined
    - Authority matrix in place
    - Documented acceptances
  - id: RISKAC-POS-002
    signal: Active acceptance management
    evidence_indicators:
    - Time-bound acceptance
    - Monitored and reviewed
    - Communicated appropriately
