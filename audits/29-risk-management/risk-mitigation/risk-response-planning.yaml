  what: |
    This audit examines risk response planning practices:
    - Documentation of specific treatment actions
    - Assignment of action owners and accountabilities
    - Timeline and milestone definition
    - Resource allocation for treatment
    - Success criteria and completion indicators
    - Integration with project and operational planning
    - Contingency planning for treatment failures
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective response planning translates strategy into action:
    - Selected strategies are meaningless without implementation plans
    - ISO 31000 requires risk treatment plans to be integrated with processes
    - Clear ownership ensures accountability for treatment
    - Defined timelines enable progress tracking
    - Without plans, risk treatment remains aspirational
    - NIST emphasizes implementing selected risk responses
    - Poor planning leads to delayed or incomplete treatment
  when_to_run:
  - After strategy selection
  - During treatment plan development
  - Quarterly treatment progress reviews
  - When treatment plans are delayed
  - Annual risk management review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RESPLAN-CRIT-001
    signal: No risk treatment plans exist
    evidence_indicators:
    - Strategies selected but no plans
    - No documented actions for treatment
    - No implementation roadmap
    explanation: |
      Without treatment plans, risk mitigation remains theoretical.
      ISO 31000 requires that risk treatment plans specify how chosen
      options will be implemented.
    remediation: |
      - Develop treatment plans for all prioritized risks
      - Document specific actions for each strategy
      - Assign owners and timelines
      - Integrate with project planning
  - id: RESPLAN-CRIT-002
    signal: Treatment actions have no owners
    evidence_indicators:
    - Actions without assigned owners
    - Generic or team-level ownership only
    - No individual accountability
    explanation: |
      Clear individual ownership is essential for accountability.
      Actions without owners tend to remain incomplete. ISO 31000
      emphasizes the importance of accountabilities in treatment.
    remediation: |
      - Assign individual owners to all actions
      - Ensure owners have authority and resources
      - Document ownership in treatment plans
      - Track owner accountability
  high:
  - id: RESPLAN-HIGH-001
    signal: Treatment plans lack timelines
    evidence_indicators:
    - No due dates for actions
    - No milestones defined
    - Open-ended treatment
    explanation: |
      Timelines create urgency and enable progress tracking. Without
      deadlines, treatment actions are deprioritized indefinitely.
    remediation: |
      - Add due dates to all actions
      - Define milestones for complex treatments
      - Track progress against timelines
      - Escalate delays
  - id: RESPLAN-HIGH-002
    signal: No success criteria defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unclear what constitutes completion
    - No measurable objectives
    - Cannot verify treatment effectiveness
    explanation: |
      Success criteria enable verification that treatment achieved
      intended risk reduction. Without them, completion is subjective.
    remediation: |
      - Define success criteria for all treatments
      - Make criteria measurable
      - Link to expected risk reduction
      - Enable completion verification
  medium:
  - id: RESPLAN-MED-001
    signal: Treatment plans not integrated with projects
    evidence_indicators:
    - Risk treatments separate from project plans
    - Resource conflicts not identified
    - Parallel planning processes
    explanation: |
      Treatment actions require resources that must be coordinated with
      other work. Isolated planning leads to conflicts and delays.
    remediation: |
      - Integrate treatment into project planning
      - Coordinate resources across activities
      - Include treatments in portfolio management
      - Align planning processes
  - id: RESPLAN-MED-002
    signal: No contingency for treatment failures
    evidence_indicators:
    - No backup plans
    - Single treatment approach
    - No escalation for delays
    explanation: |
      Treatment actions can fail or be delayed. Contingency planning
      ensures risks are still addressed if primary treatment fails.
    remediation: |
      - Develop contingency plans for critical treatments
      - Define escalation triggers
      - Identify backup approaches
      - Plan for treatment delays
  low:
  - id: RESPLAN-LOW-001
    signal: Treatment progress not tracked
    evidence_indicators:
    - No status updates on actions
    - Unclear completion status
    - No progress reporting
    explanation: |
      Progress tracking ensures timely completion and enables early
      identification of delays or issues.
    remediation: |
      - Track status of all treatment actions
      - Report progress regularly
      - Identify and address delays
      - Update risk register with progress
  positive:
  - id: RESPLAN-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive treatment planning
    evidence_indicators:
    - Detailed action plans
    - Clear ownership and timelines
    - Defined success criteria
  - id: RESPLAN-POS-002
    signal: Integrated and tracked treatment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Integrated with project planning
    - Progress tracked and reported
    - Contingency plans in place
