  what: |
    This audit examines risk transfer strategies and mechanisms:
    - Insurance coverage analysis (cyber, D&O, E&O, etc.)
    - Contractual risk allocation and indemnification
    - Outsourcing risk transfer effectiveness
    - Coverage adequacy assessment
    - Transfer vs. retention cost-benefit analysis
    - Residual risk after transfer
    - Transfer mechanism monitoring and renewal
  why_it_matters: |
    Risk transfer is a key strategy for managing certain risk types:
    - Insurance provides financial protection for insurable risks
    - Contractual provisions can allocate risk to appropriate parties
    - ISO 31000 includes risk sharing/transfer as a treatment option
    - Transfer does not eliminate risk; some exposure remains
    - Cyber insurance market has evolved with specific requirements
    - Inadequate coverage leaves organizations exposed
    - Transfer costs must be balanced against risk exposure
  when_to_run:
  - Annual insurance renewal
  - During risk treatment planning
  - When evaluating new risks for insurability
  - Contract negotiation and renewal
  - After significant incidents

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RSTRAN-CRIT-001
    signal: No insurance for significant insurable risks
    evidence_indicators:
    - Major risks without insurance coverage
    - No cyber insurance despite cyber risks
    - Uninsured professional liability
    explanation: |
      Significant insurable risks without coverage expose the organization
      to potentially catastrophic financial impact. Risk transfer through
      insurance is a fundamental strategy for managing such risks.
    remediation: |
      - Assess insurability of major risks
      - Procure appropriate insurance coverage
      - Ensure adequate coverage limits
      - Review coverage annually
  - id: RSTRAN-CRIT-002
    signal: Insurance coverage severely inadequate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Coverage limits below potential loss
    - Major exclusions for known risks
    - Deductibles exceed capacity
    explanation: |
      Inadequate coverage provides false assurance. Coverage must be
      sufficient to address potential losses, and exclusions must be
      understood.
    remediation: |
      - Assess coverage adequacy against exposure
      - Increase limits where needed
      - Review exclusions carefully
      - Consider coverage for excluded risks
  high:
  - id: RSTRAN-HIGH-001
    signal: Contractual risk allocation not reviewed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Contracts accepted without risk review
    - No legal/risk review of indemnification
    - Unknown contractual risk exposure
    explanation: |
      Contracts can allocate risk inappropriately, exposing organizations
      to liabilities they should not accept. Risk review ensures
      appropriate allocation.
    remediation: |
      - Require risk review of significant contracts
      - Engage legal and risk in contract negotiation
      - Document accepted contractual risks
      - Track contractual obligations
  - id: RSTRAN-HIGH-002
    signal: Transferred risk not tracked in risk register
    evidence_indicators:
    - Insurance not reflected in risk treatment
    - Transfer not documented in register
    - Residual from transfer unknown
    explanation: |
      Transferred risks should be documented with residual exposure noted.
      Transfer is a treatment that belongs in the risk register.
    remediation: |
      - Document transfer in risk register
      - Note transfer mechanism (insurance, contract)
      - Assess and document residual risk
      - Track transfer effectiveness
  medium:
  - id: RSTRAN-MED-001
    signal: Insurance requirements not met
    evidence_indicators:
    - Security requirements for coverage not met
    - Notification requirements not followed
    - Policy conditions not satisfied
    explanation: |
      Insurance policies have requirements that must be met for coverage
      to apply. Failing to meet requirements may void coverage when
      claims arise.
    remediation: |
      - Understand policy requirements
      - Implement required security controls
      - Establish notification procedures
      - Document compliance with requirements
  - id: RSTRAN-MED-002
    signal: Transfer cost-benefit not analyzed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Insurance purchased without analysis
    - No comparison of premium to risk
    - Over-insurance for low risks
    explanation: |
      Risk transfer has costs that should be balanced against risk
      exposure. Cost-benefit analysis ensures efficient use of transfer.
    remediation: |
      - Conduct cost-benefit analysis
      - Compare premium to expected loss
      - Optimize coverage levels
      - Balance retention and transfer
  low:
  - id: RSTRAN-LOW-001
    signal: Insurance renewal not planned proactively
    evidence_indicators:
    - Last-minute renewals
    - No market comparison
    - Coverage gaps during renewal
    explanation: |
      Proactive renewal planning ensures continuous coverage and
      enables market comparison for optimal terms.
    remediation: |
      - Plan renewals in advance
      - Compare market options
      - Ensure continuous coverage
      - Negotiate optimal terms
  positive:
  - id: RSTRAN-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive risk transfer program
    evidence_indicators:
    - Insurance coverage aligned to risks
    - Contractual risk allocation reviewed
    - Transfer documented in risk register
  - id: RSTRAN-POS-002
    signal: Proactive transfer management
    evidence_indicators:
    - Regular coverage reviews
    - Cost-benefit analysis performed
    - Requirements compliance tracked
