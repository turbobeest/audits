  what: |
    This audit examines technology obsolescence risk:
    - End-of-life and end-of-support tracking
    - Unsupported software inventory
    - Hardware aging and refresh cycles
    - Technology roadmap planning
    - Vendor support status
    - Migration planning for obsolete systems
    - Risk assessment for aging technology
  why_it_matters: |
    Technology obsolescence creates significant risks:
    - End-of-life software receives no security patches
    - Hardware failures increase with age
    - Skills for legacy systems become scarce
    - Integration with modern systems becomes difficult
    - ISO 31000 includes technology risk in scope
    - Compliance requirements may prohibit unsupported software
    - Technical debt compounds over time
  when_to_run:
  - Annual technology review
  - During strategic planning
  - When major EOL dates approach
  - After security incidents
  - Before budget planning

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TECHOBS-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical systems running unsupported software
    evidence_indicators:
    - EOL operating systems
    - Unsupported frameworks
    - No security patches available
    explanation: |
      Unsupported software receives no security patches, leaving
      critical systems vulnerable to known exploits.
    remediation: |
      - Inventory unsupported software
      - Assess risk exposure
      - Plan migration or upgrade
      - Implement compensating controls
  - id: TECHOBS-CRIT-002
    signal: No EOL tracking process
    evidence_indicators:
    - EOL dates unknown
    - No inventory
    - Surprises when support ends
    explanation: |
      Without tracking, EOL dates surprise the organization,
      leaving insufficient time to plan and migrate.
    remediation: |
      - Implement EOL tracking
      - Inventory all systems
      - Track vendor announcements
      - Plan proactively
  high:
  - id: TECHOBS-HIGH-001
    signal: No technology roadmap for obsolete systems
    evidence_indicators:
    - No migration plans
    - Obsolete systems without plan
    - Indefinite legacy
    explanation: |
      Without roadmaps, obsolete systems persist indefinitely,
      accumulating risk and technical debt.
    remediation: |
      - Create technology roadmap
      - Plan migrations
      - Budget for refreshes
      - Execute systematically
  - id: TECHOBS-HIGH-002
    signal: Skills gap for legacy systems
    evidence_indicators:
    - Few experts remaining
    - No succession
    - Knowledge at risk
    explanation: |
      Skills for legacy systems diminish over time. Without
      succession planning, systems become unmaintainable.
    remediation: |
      - Assess skills availability
      - Document knowledge
      - Plan succession
      - Accelerate migration
  medium:
  - id: TECHOBS-MED-001
    signal: Hardware refresh cycles not defined
    evidence_indicators:
    - No refresh schedule
    - Aging hardware
    - Reactive replacement only
    explanation: |
      Defined refresh cycles enable proactive replacement
      before failures. Reactive approach increases downtime.
    remediation: |
      - Define refresh cycles
      - Track hardware age
      - Budget for replacement
      - Replace proactively
  - id: TECHOBS-MED-002
    signal: Obsolescence risk not in risk register
    evidence_indicators:
    - Not tracked as risk
    - No ownership
    - No treatment plan
    explanation: |
      Obsolescence should be managed as a risk. Without
      formal tracking, it may not receive appropriate attention.
    remediation: |
      - Add to risk register
      - Assign ownership
      - Assess impact
      - Plan treatment
  low:
  - id: TECHOBS-LOW-001
    signal: Vendor support status not monitored
    evidence_indicators:
    - No vendor monitoring
    - EOL announcements missed
    - Limited awareness
    explanation: |
      Monitoring vendor announcements enables proactive
      planning for support changes.
    remediation: |
      - Monitor vendor announcements
      - Track support policies
      - Update planning accordingly
      - Communicate changes
  positive:
  - id: TECHOBS-POS-001
    signal: Mature obsolescence management
    evidence_indicators:
    - EOL tracking
    - Proactive planning
    - No critical obsolescence
  - id: TECHOBS-POS-002
    signal: Current technology stack
    evidence_indicators:
    - Supported versions
    - Regular refreshes
    - Modern architecture
