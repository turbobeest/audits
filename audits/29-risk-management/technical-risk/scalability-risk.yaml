  what: |
    This audit examines scalability risk management:
    - Architectural scalability constraints
    - Horizontal and vertical scaling capability
    - Auto-scaling mechanisms
    - Data layer scalability
    - Third-party scalability limits
    - Growth forecasting and planning
    - Scalability testing practices
  why_it_matters: |
    Scalability constraints limit business growth:
    - Inability to scale blocks growth opportunities
    - Scaling bottlenecks cause outages during peaks
    - Architectural constraints may require rewrites
    - Data scalability often the hardest problem
    - ISO 31000 includes strategic risk
    - Cloud architectures still have scalability limits
    - Late discovery of constraints is expensive
  when_to_run:
  - During strategic planning
  - Before major growth initiatives
  - After scalability issues
  - Quarterly architecture review
  - When evaluating new architectures

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SCALRISK-CRIT-001
    signal: Architecture cannot scale to meet growth
    evidence_indicators:
    - Known bottlenecks
    - Cannot scale horizontally
    - Database limits reached
    explanation: |
      Architectural constraints that prevent scaling block
      business growth and cause failures during peaks.
    remediation: |
      - Assess architectural constraints
      - Plan for re-architecture
      - Address bottlenecks
      - Enable scaling
  - id: SCALRISK-CRIT-002
    signal: Scaling limits reached without plan
    evidence_indicators:
    - At maximum capacity
    - No scaling path
    - Growth blocked
    explanation: |
      Reaching scaling limits without a plan creates immediate
      risk and blocks business opportunities.
    remediation: |
      - Assess current limits
      - Plan scaling path
      - Implement improvements
      - Enable growth
  high:
  - id: SCALRISK-HIGH-001
    signal: Data layer scalability not addressed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Single database
    - No sharding
    - Data growth unconstrained
    explanation: |
      Data layer is often the hardest to scale. Unaddressed
      data scalability becomes a critical constraint.
    remediation: |
      - Assess data scalability
      - Plan for data growth
      - Consider sharding
      - Evaluate alternatives
  - id: SCALRISK-HIGH-002
    signal: No auto-scaling capability
    evidence_indicators:
    - Manual scaling only
    - Cannot respond to demand
    - Peak capacity static
    explanation: |
      Auto-scaling enables response to demand variations.
      Manual scaling is slow and may miss peaks.
    remediation: |
      - Implement auto-scaling
      - Configure thresholds
      - Test scaling behavior
      - Enable rapid response
  medium:
  - id: SCALRISK-MED-001
    signal: Scalability not tested
    evidence_indicators:
    - No scale testing
    - Limits unknown
    - Scaling untested
    explanation: |
      Testing reveals scalability limits before production.
      Untested systems may fail under load.
    remediation: |
      - Test scalability
      - Identify limits
      - Document constraints
      - Plan improvements
  - id: SCALRISK-MED-002
    signal: Third-party scalability limits unknown
    evidence_indicators:
    - Vendor limits unknown
    - No rate limit awareness
    - Dependencies not assessed
    explanation: |
      Third-party limits can constrain overall scalability.
      Understanding limits enables planning.
    remediation: |
      - Assess vendor limits
      - Document constraints
      - Plan for limits
      - Consider alternatives
  low:
  - id: SCALRISK-LOW-001
    signal: Scalability not in architecture reviews
    evidence_indicators:
    - Not assessed in reviews
    - Limited consideration
    - Afterthought
    explanation: |
      Scalability should be considered in architecture.
      Late consideration leads to constraints.
    remediation: |
      - Include in reviews
      - Assess early
      - Design for scale
      - Document decisions

  - id: SCALRISK-POS-001

    - No bottlenecks
  - id: SCALRISK-POS-002
    signal: Tested scalability

    - Scale tested
    - Limits known
    - Growth capacity
