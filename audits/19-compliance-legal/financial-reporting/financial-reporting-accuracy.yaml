  what: |
    Evaluates accuracy of financial reporting including:
    - Calculation accuracy in financial systems
    - Report generation and consolidation processes
    - Disclosure completeness and accuracy
    - Automated vs. manual report elements
    - Period close and cutoff procedures
    - Journal entry controls
    - Financial statement presentation
    - Footnote and disclosure generation
  why_it_matters: |
    Financial reporting accuracy is essential for investor decisions,
    regulatory compliance, and organizational credibility. Inaccuracies
    result in:
    - Material misstatements requiring restatement
    - SEC enforcement and penalties
    - Audit qualifications and increased scrutiny
    - Shareholder lawsuits
    - Executive personal liability
    - Loss of market confidence
    - Damage to company reputation
  when_to_run:
  - During annual financial audit preparation
  - After implementing reporting system changes
  - Following restatement or material adjustments
  - During system consolidation projects

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FRA-CRIT-001
    signal: Calculation errors in financial reports
    evidence_indicators:
    - Totals do not sum correctly
    - Rounding errors in aggregations
    - Currency conversion errors
    explanation: |
      Calculation errors directly cause financial misstatements.
      Even small errors can compound to material amounts.
    remediation: Implement calculation verification and automated testing
  - id: FRA-CRIT-002
    signal: Report data does not reconcile to source
    evidence_indicators:
    - Report totals differ from underlying data
    - Unexplained variances in consolidation
    - Missing transactions in reports
    explanation: |
      Reports must accurately reflect underlying data. Unexplained
      variances indicate control failures or data corruption.
    remediation: Implement source-to-report reconciliation controls
  - id: FRA-CRIT-003
    signal: Manual adjustments without controls
    evidence_indicators:
    - Spreadsheet-based adjustments to reports
    - No approval for manual overrides
    - Undocumented adjustments
    explanation: |
      Uncontrolled manual adjustments bypass system controls and
      create opportunity for error and manipulation.
    remediation: Implement approval workflow and audit trail for adjustments
  high:
  - id: FRA-HIGH-001
    signal: Disclosure generation not validated
    explanation: Incorrect disclosures can mislead investors and violate regulations
    remediation: Implement disclosure accuracy verification procedures
  - id: FRA-HIGH-002
    signal: Period cutoff procedures inadequate
    explanation: Poor cutoff leads to transactions in wrong periods
    remediation: Strengthen period close procedures with verification
  - id: FRA-HIGH-003
    signal: Consolidation logic undocumented
    explanation: Undocumented consolidation cannot be verified
    remediation: Document all consolidation rules and intercompany eliminations
  medium:
  - id: FRA-MED-001
    signal: Report testing limited to format only
    remediation: Implement data accuracy testing for all reports
  - id: FRA-MED-002
    signal: Precision handling inconsistent
    remediation: Standardize rounding rules across calculations
  low:
  - id: FRA-LOW-001
    signal: Report documentation incomplete
  positive:
  - id: FRA-POS-001
    signal: Automated report validation and reconciliation
  - id: FRA-POS-002
