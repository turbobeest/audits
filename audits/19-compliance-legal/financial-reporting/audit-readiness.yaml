  what: |
    Evaluates organizational readiness for external audits including:
    - Documentation completeness and accessibility
    - Evidence collection and retention processes
    - Control testing status and remediation tracking
    - Audit trail availability and integrity
    - Key personnel availability and preparation
    - Prior finding remediation status
    - Walkthrough readiness
    - Request list preparation capability
  why_it_matters: |
    Audit readiness directly impacts audit efficiency and outcomes.
    Poor preparation results in:
    - Extended audit timelines and increased fees
    - Greater likelihood of findings and qualifications
    - Management distraction during busy periods
    - Potential scope expansion due to missing evidence
    - Reputation impact with auditors and regulators
    - Delayed financial reporting
    - Increased risk of material weakness identification
  when_to_run:
  - 2-3 months before scheduled external audit
  - After significant organizational changes
  - Following system implementations
  - During pre-IPO preparation

signals:
  critical:
  - id: AR-CRIT-001
    signal: Control documentation missing or significantly outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Control narratives more than one year old
    - Key controls undocumented
    - Documentation does not match current processes
    explanation: |
      Auditors rely on accurate control documentation. Missing or
      outdated documentation creates audit findings and delays.
    remediation: Update all control documentation before audit commencement
  - id: AR-CRIT-002
    signal: Prior audit findings not remediated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Open findings from previous audit
    - Remediation plans not implemented
    - Same issues recurring
    explanation: |
      Unremediated findings demonstrate control weakness and lack
      of management commitment. Repeat findings escalate severity.
    remediation: Complete remediation or document compensating controls
  - id: AR-CRIT-003
    signal: Critical evidence unavailable or not retained
    evidence_indicators:
    - Required evidence deleted or lost
    - Retention period insufficient
    - Evidence cannot be produced on request
    explanation: |
      Missing evidence forces auditors to scope alternatives or
      expand testing, often resulting in findings.
    remediation: Implement proper evidence retention and accessibility
  high:
  - id: AR-HIGH-001
    signal: Control owners unprepared for walkthroughs
    explanation: Unprepared control owners create audit delays and confusion
    remediation: Conduct pre-audit walkthrough preparation sessions
  - id: AR-HIGH-002
    signal: Evidence scattered across multiple systems
    explanation: Fragmented evidence delays audit and increases errors
    remediation: Consolidate evidence into central repository before audit
  - id: AR-HIGH-003
    signal: No dedicated audit response team
    explanation: Ad-hoc responses create inconsistency and delays
    remediation: Establish audit response team with clear responsibilities
  medium:
  - id: AR-MED-001
    signal: Audit timeline conflicts with business activities
    remediation: Plan audit timing considering business calendar
  - id: AR-MED-002
    signal: Evidence formatting inconsistent
    remediation: Standardize evidence formats and naming conventions
  low:
  - id: AR-LOW-001
    signal: Audit logistics not finalized
  positive:
  - id: AR-POS-001
    signal: All evidence pre-staged and indexed
  - id: AR-POS-002
    signal: Control owners briefed and walkthrough-ready
  - id: AR-POS-003
    signal: Prior findings fully remediated with evidence
