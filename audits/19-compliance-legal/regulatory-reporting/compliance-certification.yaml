  what: |
    Evaluates compliance certification processes including:
    - Third-party certification status (ISO, SOC, etc.)
    - Internal compliance attestation processes
    - Management certification requirements
    - Certification scope and coverage
    - Audit and assessment schedules
    - Finding remediation tracking
    - Certification renewal planning
    - Customer certification requirements
  why_it_matters: |
    Compliance certifications provide independent verification of
    compliance status. Certification failures result in:
    - Loss of customer confidence and contracts
    - Inability to compete for certification-requiring contracts
    - Regulatory concerns about compliance program
    - Gap in third-party validation
    - Market access restrictions
    - Public disclosure of certification failures
    - Increased audit and assessment scrutiny
    Many customers and regulations require certifications.
  when_to_run:
  - During certification planning or renewal
  - When entering markets requiring certifications
  - During annual compliance reviews
  - After certification scope changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CC-CRIT-001
    signal: Required certification expired or invalid
    evidence_indicators:
    - Certification past expiration date
    - Scope no longer covers operations
    - Certification withdrawn by certifying body
    explanation: |
      Expired certifications cannot be claimed to customers or
      regulators. This may violate contractual obligations.
    remediation: Renew certification immediately or correct scope
  - id: CC-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical audit findings not remediated
    evidence_indicators:
    - High/critical findings from certification audits
    - Findings open beyond remediation deadline
    - Same findings recurring across audits
    explanation: |
      Unremediated critical findings may result in certification
      withdrawal and indicate control failures.
    remediation: Prioritize remediation of critical findings
  - id: CC-CRIT-003

    evidence_indicators:
