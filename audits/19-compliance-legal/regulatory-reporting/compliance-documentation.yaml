  what: |
    Evaluates compliance documentation including:
    - Policy and procedure documentation completeness
    - Regulatory requirement mapping
    - Evidence collection and retention
    - Document version control and currency
    - Accessibility and organization of records
    - Audit trail documentation
    - Compliance attestation records
    - Third-party compliance documentation
  why_it_matters: |
    Compliance documentation is essential for demonstrating regulatory
    compliance. Documentation failures result in:
    - Inability to demonstrate compliance during audits
    - Regulatory findings and enforcement actions
    - Failed certification and attestation processes
    - Increased audit scope and costs
    - Legal discovery disadvantages
    - Knowledge loss during staff turnover
    - Inconsistent compliance practices
    "If it isn't documented, it didn't happen" applies to compliance.
  when_to_run:
  - Before regulatory examinations
  - During annual compliance reviews
  - After organizational changes
  - When onboarding new regulations

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CD-CRIT-001
    signal: Key compliance policies missing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Required policies not documented
    - Policy gaps for regulated activities
    - No policy for known compliance requirements
    explanation: |
      Missing policies indicate compliance program gaps and make
      it impossible to demonstrate regulatory compliance.
    remediation: Develop and implement missing compliance policies
  - id: CD-CRIT-002
    signal: Compliance evidence not retained
    evidence_indicators:
    - Evidence not collected for required activities
    - Retention period not met
    - Evidence destroyed prematurely
    explanation: |
      Without evidence, compliance cannot be demonstrated.
      Missing evidence may be presumed as non-compliance.
    remediation: Implement evidence collection and retention procedures
  - id: CD-CRIT-003
    signal: No mapping of requirements to controls
    evidence_indicators:
    - No compliance matrix or mapping
    - Controls not linked to requirements
    - Coverage gaps unknown
    explanation: |
      Without requirement mapping, compliance coverage cannot
      be assessed and gaps may go undetected.
    remediation: Create comprehensive requirement-to-control mapping
  high:
  - id: CD-HIGH-001
    signal: Documentation significantly outdated
    explanation: Outdated documentation may not reflect current practices
    remediation: Establish regular documentation review cycle
  - id: CD-HIGH-002
    signal: Documentation inaccessible or disorganized
    explanation: Inaccessible documentation cannot support audits
    remediation: Implement organized, searchable document repository
  - id: CD-HIGH-003
    signal: Version control not maintained
    explanation: Without version control, document currency cannot be determined
    remediation: Implement document version control
  medium:
  - id: CD-MED-001
    signal: Third-party compliance documentation incomplete
    remediation: Collect and maintain vendor compliance documentation
  - id: CD-MED-002
    signal: Documentation ownership unclear
    remediation: Assign document owners with update responsibilities
  low:
  - id: CD-LOW-001
    signal: Documentation formatting inconsistent
  positive:
  - id: CD-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive requirement mapping with evidence links
  - id: CD-POS-002
    signal: Regular documentation review and update process
