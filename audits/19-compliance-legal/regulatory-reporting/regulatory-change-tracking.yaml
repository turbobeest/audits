  what: |
    Evaluates regulatory change management including:
    - Regulatory monitoring and horizon scanning
    - Change identification and assessment processes
    - Impact analysis methodology
    - Implementation planning and tracking
    - Stakeholder communication
    - Compliance verification after implementation
    - Documentation of regulatory changes
    - Regulatory intelligence sources
  why_it_matters: |
    The regulatory landscape constantly evolves. Failure to track
    and respond to changes results in:
    - Non-compliance with new requirements
    - Regulatory enforcement and penalties
    - Competitive disadvantage vs. prepared competitors
    - Rushed, error-prone implementations
    - Missed implementation deadlines
    - Reputational damage
    - Business disruption from reactive responses
    Proactive regulatory change management is essential.
  when_to_run:
  - During annual compliance reviews
  - When implementing change management processes
  - After regulatory change-related incidents
  - Before regulatory examinations

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RCT-CRIT-001
    signal: No formal regulatory change monitoring
    evidence_indicators:
    - No systematic monitoring of regulatory sources
    - Reactive-only awareness of changes
    - Reliance on ad-hoc information
    explanation: |
      Without formal monitoring, regulatory changes may be
      discovered after effective dates, causing non-compliance.
    remediation: Implement formal regulatory monitoring process with defined sources
  - id: RCT-CRIT-002
    signal: Regulatory changes not assessed for impact
    evidence_indicators:
    - No impact analysis performed
    - Changes implemented without assessment
    - Scope of changes not understood
    explanation: |
      Without impact assessment, implementation may be incomplete
      or resources may be misallocated.
    remediation: Implement formal impact assessment methodology
  - id: RCT-CRIT-003
    signal: Regulatory changes implemented late or not at all
    evidence_indicators:
    - Missed implementation deadlines
    - Backlog of unimplemented changes
    - No tracking of implementation status
    explanation: |
      Late or missing implementation directly causes non-compliance
      and regulatory exposure.
    remediation: Implement tracking with accountability for on-time implementation
  high:
  - id: RCT-HIGH-001
    signal: Implementation not verified for effectiveness
    explanation: Implementation must be verified to ensure compliance
    remediation: Implement post-implementation compliance verification
  - id: RCT-HIGH-002
    signal: Stakeholders not notified of changes
    explanation: Affected teams need awareness to comply
    remediation: Establish stakeholder communication process
  - id: RCT-HIGH-003
    signal: No prioritization of changes
    explanation: Without prioritization, critical changes may be delayed
    remediation: Implement risk-based prioritization methodology
  medium:
  - id: RCT-MED-001
    signal: Regulatory inventory incomplete
    remediation: Conduct comprehensive regulatory mapping
  - id: RCT-MED-002
    signal: No lessons learned from past implementations
    remediation: Implement post-implementation review process
  low:
  - id: RCT-LOW-001
    signal: Change tracking documentation could be improved
  positive:
  - id: RCT-POS-001
    signal: Proactive regulatory horizon scanning
  - id: RCT-POS-002
    signal: Systematic change management with tracking
