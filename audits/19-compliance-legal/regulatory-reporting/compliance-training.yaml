  what: |
    Evaluates compliance training programs including:
    - Training content coverage and currency
    - Training completion rates and tracking
    - Training effectiveness assessment
    - Role-based training requirements
    - New hire and ongoing training programs
    - Regulatory-specific training requirements
    - Training documentation and records
    - Remedial training processes
  why_it_matters: |
    Compliance training is essential for ensuring employees understand
    and can fulfill their compliance obligations. Training failures lead to:
    - Compliance violations due to ignorance
    - Regulatory findings for inadequate training
    - Inability to demonstrate compliance program effectiveness
    - Increased risk of misconduct
    - Legal exposure from untrained employees
    - Regulatory mandate violations (many require specific training)
    - Culture of non-compliance
    Regulators increasingly scrutinize training program effectiveness.
  when_to_run:
  - During annual compliance reviews
  - Before regulatory examinations
  - When implementing new training programs
  - After compliance incidents attributed to training gaps

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CT-CRIT-001
    signal: Mandatory regulatory training not provided
    evidence_indicators:
    - Required training not in curriculum
    - Regulatory-mandated topics not covered
    - No training for regulated activities
    explanation: |
      Many regulations explicitly require specific training.
      Missing mandatory training is a direct compliance violation.
    remediation: Implement all regulatory-required training immediately
  - id: CT-CRIT-002
    signal: Low training completion rates
    evidence_indicators:
    - Less than 90% completion for mandatory training
    - Large populations not completing training
    - No follow-up for non-completion
    explanation: |
      Incomplete training leaves employees unaware of compliance
      obligations. Low rates indicate systemic failure.
    remediation: Implement enforcement mechanisms and escalation for completion
  - id: CT-CRIT-003
    signal: No training records maintained
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot demonstrate who was trained
    - No completion tracking
    - Records not retained
    explanation: |
      Regulators require proof of training. Without records,
      training cannot be demonstrated during audits.
    remediation: Implement comprehensive training record-keeping
  high:
  - id: CT-HIGH-001
    signal: Training content significantly outdated
    explanation: Outdated content teaches incorrect information
    remediation: Update training content to reflect current requirements
  - id: CT-HIGH-002
    signal: No training effectiveness measurement
    explanation: Cannot improve what is not measured
    remediation: Implement knowledge assessments and effectiveness metrics
  - id: CT-HIGH-003
    signal: Role-based training not implemented
    explanation: Different roles have different compliance obligations
    remediation: Develop role-specific training paths
  medium:
  - id: CT-MED-001
    signal: New hire training delayed
    remediation: Ensure training within regulatory timeframes
  - id: CT-MED-002
    signal: No refresher training program
    remediation: Implement periodic refresher training
  low:
  - id: CT-LOW-001
    signal: Training delivery could be more engaging
  positive:
  - id: CT-POS-001
    signal: High completion rates with effective assessment
  - id: CT-POS-002
    signal: Role-based training with regular updates
