  what: |
    Evaluates regulatory reporting timeliness including:
    - Deadline tracking and management systems
    - Historical on-time submission rates
    - Buffer time and contingency planning
    - Report preparation workflow efficiency
    - Data availability for reporting
    - Review and approval cycle times
    - Submission confirmation processes
    - Late filing tracking and root cause analysis
  why_it_matters: |
    Timely regulatory reporting is a fundamental compliance obligation.
    Late filings result in:
    - Regulatory fines and penalties
    - Increased regulatory scrutiny
    - Reputational damage with regulators
    - Loss of business licenses or authorizations
    - Public disclosure of late filings
    - Management certification issues
    - Stakeholder confidence erosion
    Many regulators have zero tolerance for repeated late filings.
  when_to_run:
  - During annual compliance reviews
  - After late filing incidents
  - When onboarding new reporting requirements
  - Before regulatory examinations

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RRT-CRIT-001
    signal: History of repeated late filings
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple late submissions in past 12 months
    - Pattern of same report being late
    - No improvement trend
    explanation: |
      Repeated late filings indicate systemic process failure and
      attract heightened regulatory scrutiny and escalating penalties.
    remediation: Conduct root cause analysis and implement process improvements
  - id: RRT-CRIT-002
    signal: No deadline tracking or calendar system
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deadlines tracked informally or in spreadsheets
    - No alerting for approaching deadlines
    - Reliance on individual memory
    explanation: |
      Without systematic deadline tracking, late filings are
      inevitable. This represents a control gap.
    remediation: Implement formal deadline tracking with automated alerts
  - id: RRT-CRIT-003
    signal: Insufficient buffer time before deadlines
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reports completed day of deadline
    - No time for review and correction
    - Single point of failure in process
    explanation: |
      Last-minute report completion leaves no margin for issues
      and increases error risk in submitted reports.
    remediation: Establish mandatory buffer periods with internal deadlines
  high:
  - id: RRT-HIGH-001
    signal: Data availability issues causing delays
    explanation: Upstream data problems cascade to reporting delays
    remediation: Establish data delivery SLAs and monitoring
  - id: RRT-HIGH-002
    signal: Review bottleneck delaying submissions
    explanation: Approval process delays risk late filings
    remediation: Streamline review process with backup approvers
  - id: RRT-HIGH-003
    signal: No contingency for staff unavailability
    explanation: Key person dependency risks deadline failures
    remediation: Cross-train staff and document procedures
  medium:
  - id: RRT-MED-001
    signal: Submission confirmation not tracked
    remediation: Implement submission confirmation and record retention
  - id: RRT-MED-002
    signal: Root cause analysis not performed for delays
    remediation: Conduct post-incident analysis for all late filings
  low:
  - id: RRT-LOW-001
    signal: Reporting calendar not shared across stakeholders
  positive:
  - id: RRT-POS-001
    signal: 100% on-time filing rate
  - id: RRT-POS-002
    signal: Automated deadline management with escalation
