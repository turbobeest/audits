description:
  what: |
    Comprehensive evaluation of HIPAA compliance including Privacy Rule,
    Security Rule, and Breach Notification Rule requirements. Reviews
    administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protected health
    information (PHI). Assesses risk analysis, policies, training, business
    associate agreements, and incident response procedures.
  why_it_matters: |
    HIPAA compliance is mandatory for covered entities and business associates
    handling PHI. Violations result in substantial penalties (up to $1.9M per
    violation category annually), criminal prosecution for knowing violations,
    and OCR enforcement actions. Breaches require notification and trigger
    investigations. PHI exposure causes significant patient harm and
    organizational reputational damage.
  when_to_run:
  - Before handling PHI in applications
  - During annual HIPAA compliance reviews
  - After security incidents involving PHI
  - When onboarding as business associate
  - After significant system changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: HIPAA-CRIT-001
    signal: No risk analysis conducted
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented risk analysis
    - Threats to PHI not identified
    - No risk management plan
    explanation: |
      45 CFR 164.308(a)(1) requires accurate and thorough risk analysis.
      Risk analysis is foundational requirement; without it, safeguards
      cannot be appropriately selected. OCR consistently cites missing
      risk analysis in enforcement actions.
    remediation: Conduct comprehensive HIPAA risk analysis
  - id: HIPAA-CRIT-002
    signal: PHI transmitted without encryption
    evidence_indicators:
    - ePHI sent over unencrypted channels
    - No TLS for PHI transmission
    - Unencrypted email with PHI
    explanation: |
      45 CFR 164.312(e)(1) requires transmission security. Unencrypted
      ePHI in transit is interceptable, exposing patient information.
      Encryption is addressable but must be implemented or documented why not.
    remediation: Implement encryption for all ePHI transmission
  - id: HIPAA-CRIT-003
    signal: No Business Associate Agreements
    evidence_indicators:
    - Third parties access PHI
    - No BAAs executed
    - BAAs missing required provisions
    explanation: |
      45 CFR 164.308(b)(1) requires BAAs with all business associates.
      Without BAAs, covered entity has no contractual protections and
      business associate has no HIPAA obligations.
    remediation: Execute compliant BAAs with all business associates
  high:
  - id: HIPAA-HIGH-001
    signal: No audit controls implemented
    explanation: 45 CFR 164.312(b) requires audit controls for ePHI systems
    remediation: Implement comprehensive audit logging for ePHI access
  - id: HIPAA-HIGH-002
    signal: No workforce training program
    explanation: 45 CFR 164.308(a)(5) requires security awareness training
    remediation: Implement HIPAA training for all workforce members
