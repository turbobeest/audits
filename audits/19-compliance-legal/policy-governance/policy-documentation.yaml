  what: |
    Evaluates policy documentation including:
    - Policy completeness against regulatory requirements
    - Policy clarity and readability
    - Policy structure and organization
    - Alignment between policies and procedures
    - Policy accessibility and distribution
    - Version control and approval documentation
    - Policy hierarchy (policies, standards, procedures)
    - Gap analysis against frameworks
  why_it_matters: |
    Policies are the foundation of governance and compliance.
    Poor policy documentation results in:
    - Regulatory findings for missing required policies
    - Inconsistent behavior from unclear guidance
    - Audit failures for inadequate documentation
    - Legal exposure from missing policies
    - Employee confusion about expectations
    - Inability to enforce non-existent policies
    - Compliance program foundation weakness
    Clear, complete policies enable effective compliance.
  when_to_run:
  - During annual policy reviews
  - Before regulatory examinations
  - When implementing new compliance programs
  - After organizational changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PD-CRIT-001
    signal: Required policies missing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Regulatory-mandated policies not documented
    - Key compliance areas without policy coverage
    - Framework requirements not addressed
    explanation: |
      Missing required policies is a direct compliance violation
      and leaves the organization without governance foundation.
    remediation: Develop all required policies based on regulatory mapping
  - id: PD-CRIT-002
