  what: |
    Evaluates policy lifecycle management including:
    - Review schedule and frequency
    - Review process and participants
    - Update triggers and change management
    - Approval workflow for changes
    - Communication of policy changes
    - Policy retirement process
    - Version control and history
    - Integration with regulatory changes
  why_it_matters: |
    Policies require regular review to remain effective.
    Poor lifecycle management leads to:
    - Outdated policies providing wrong guidance
    - Non-compliance with changed regulations
    - Accumulated policy debt
    - Conflicting or redundant policies
    - Audit findings for stale policies
    - Inability to respond to changing risks
    - Erosion of policy program credibility
    Active lifecycle management keeps policies relevant.
  when_to_run:
  - During annual policy assessments
  - When establishing policy programs
  - After finding outdated policies
  - During compliance program reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PRC-CRIT-001
    signal: No defined policy review process
    evidence_indicators:
    - No review schedule or calendar
    - Reviews performed ad-hoc only
    - No accountability for reviews
    explanation: |
      Without defined process, policies become stale and

    evidence_indicators:
    - Key policies have no recent review date
    - Review backlog of critical policies
    - No plan to address review gaps
    explanation: |
      Significantly outdated policies likely contain incorrect
      guidance and may not address current regulations.
    remediation: Prioritize review of overdue critical policies
  high:
