signals:
  critical:
  - id: GS-CRIT-001
    signal: No board/executive oversight of compliance
    evidence_indicators:
    - No compliance committee or oversight body
    - Compliance not on board agenda
    - No executive accountability for compliance
    explanation: |
      Board oversight is required by most regulatory frameworks.
      Missing oversight demonstrates governance failure.
    remediation: Establish board-level compliance oversight
  - id: GS-CRIT-002
    signal: Compliance function lacks independence
    evidence_indicators:
    - CCO reports to business rather than board
    - Compliance function can be overridden
    - Conflicts of interest in reporting
    explanation: |
      Compliance function requires independence to be effective.
      Compromised independence undermines entire program.
    remediation: Ensure compliance function independence with appropriate reporting
  - id: GS-CRIT-003
    signal: No clear accountability for compliance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Compliance responsibilities unclear
    - No one accountable for compliance failures
    - Diffuse responsibility across organization
    explanation: |
      Without clear accountability, compliance gaps persist.
      Regulators expect clear ownership of compliance.
    remediation: Define and communicate compliance accountability
  high:
  - id: GS-HIGH-001
    signal: First line does not own compliance risks
    explanation: Business units must own their compliance obligations
    remediation: Implement three lines model with first line ownership
  - id: GS-HIGH-002

    explanation: Issues must reach appropriate levels for resolution
    remediation: Define and test escalation procedures
  - id: GS-HIGH-003
    signal: Governance committees not meeting or ineffective
    explanation: Inactive governance provides no oversight
    remediation: Revitalize governance committee activity
  medium:
  - id: GS-MED-001
    signal: Role overlap creates confusion
    remediation: Clarify roles and responsibilities
  - id: GS-MED-002
    signal: Governance reporting insufficient
    remediation: Enhance governance reporting content and frequency
  low:
  - id: GS-LOW-001
    signal: Governance documentation could be improved
  positive:
  - id: GS-POS-001
    signal: Clear three lines model with defined responsibilities
