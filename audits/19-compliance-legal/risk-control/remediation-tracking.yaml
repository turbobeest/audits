  what: |
    Evaluates remediation tracking processes including:
    - Finding intake and prioritization
    - Remediation plan development
    - Owner assignment and accountability
    - Progress tracking and reporting
    - Deadline management and escalation
    - Closure verification and evidence
    - Trend analysis and root cause
    - Integration with risk and audit processes
  why_it_matters: |
    Remediation tracking ensures identified issues are resolved.
    Poor remediation management leads to:
    - Persistent control deficiencies
    - Recurring audit findings
    - Regulatory criticism for open issues
    - Increased risk from unaddressed vulnerabilities
    - Audit findings about remediation itself
    - Loss of credibility with auditors and regulators
    - Compliance program ineffectiveness
    Finding issues has no value without effective remediation.
  when_to_run:
  - Before regulatory examinations
  - During compliance program reviews
  - After audit finding releases
  - When implementing tracking systems

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RT-CRIT-001
    signal: No formal remediation tracking process
    evidence_indicators:
    - No remediation register or tracking system
    - Findings tracked informally
    - No visibility into open issues
    explanation: |
      Without formal tracking, findings may be forgotten and
      never remediated, leaving risks unaddressed.
    remediation: Implement formal remediation tracking system
  - id: RT-CRIT-002
    signal: Large backlog of overdue remediations
    evidence_indicators:
    - Significant findings past due
    - No escalation for overdue items
    - Aging findings without progress
    explanation: |
      Overdue remediations indicate process failure and
      persistent risk exposure. Regulators scrutinize backlogs.
    remediation: Prioritize overdue items and implement escalation
  - id: RT-CRIT-003
    signal: Remediations closed without verification
    evidence_indicators:
    - No evidence of remediation
    - Self-certification without review
    - Closure based on intent not action
    explanation: |
      Unverified closures may leave issues unresolved.
      Auditors will reopen findings closed without evidence.
    remediation: Require evidence and verification for closure
  high:
  - id: RT-HIGH-001
    signal: Finding owners not clearly assigned
    explanation: Without clear ownership, accountability is diffuse
    remediation: Assign specific owners for all findings
  - id: RT-HIGH-002
    signal: Remediation deadlines unrealistic
    explanation: Unrealistic deadlines lead to extensions or missed dates
    remediation: Set realistic deadlines based on complexity
  - id: RT-HIGH-003
    signal: No escalation for at-risk remediations
    explanation: Early escalation enables intervention before deadline
    remediation: Implement proactive escalation triggers
  medium:
  - id: RT-MED-001
    signal: Remediation reporting inconsistent
    remediation: Standardize progress reporting
  - id: RT-MED-002
    signal: Root cause analysis not performed
    remediation: Require root cause analysis for significant findings
  low:
  - id: RT-LOW-001
    signal: Remediation tracking could be more efficient
  positive:
  - id: RT-POS-001
    signal: High on-time remediation rate with verified closure
  - id: RT-POS-002
    signal: Proactive tracking with early warning escalation
