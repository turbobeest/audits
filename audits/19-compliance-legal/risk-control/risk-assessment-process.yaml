  what: |
    Evaluates risk assessment processes including:
    - Risk identification methodology
    - Risk assessment and scoring criteria
    - Risk appetite and tolerance alignment
    - Assessment frequency and triggers
    - Stakeholder involvement in assessments
    - Risk documentation and communication
    - Integration with control framework
    - Emerging risk identification
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective risk assessment is foundational to risk management.
    Poor risk assessment leads to:
    - Unknown risks that materialize without mitigation
    - Misallocated resources on low-priority risks
    - Control gaps for unidentified risks
    - Strategic decisions without risk context
    - Regulatory findings for assessment deficiencies
    - Compliance program ineffectiveness
    - Audit focus on wrong areas
    You cannot manage risks you haven't identified and assessed.
  when_to_run:
  - During annual risk assessment cycle
  - When implementing risk management programs
  - Before strategic planning cycles
  - After significant organizational changes

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RAP-CRIT-001
    signal: No formal risk assessment process
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented risk methodology
    - Risks identified ad-hoc only
    - No systematic risk evaluation
    explanation: |
      Without formal process, risk identification is incomplete
      and inconsistent, leaving significant exposures unaddressed.
    remediation: Implement formal risk assessment methodology
  - id: RAP-CRIT-002
    signal: Risk register significantly incomplete
    evidence_indicators:
    - Major risk categories missing
    - Known risks not documented
    - Emerging risks not considered
    explanation: |
      Incomplete risk registers result in unmitigated risks
      and misinformed decision-making.
    remediation: Conduct comprehensive risk identification exercise
  - id: RAP-CRIT-003
    signal: Risk assessments not performed or outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - No recent risk assessment
    - Assessment older than one year
    - Significant changes not assessed
    explanation: |
      Outdated assessments do not reflect current risk profile
      and may result in ineffective risk response.
    remediation: Conduct current risk assessment and establish regular schedule
  high:
  - id: RAP-HIGH-001
    signal: Risk scoring criteria inconsistent
    explanation: Inconsistent scoring prevents meaningful prioritization
    remediation: Standardize risk scoring methodology
  - id: RAP-HIGH-002
    signal: Business units not involved in assessment
    explanation: Risk owners must participate for complete identification
    remediation: Involve business stakeholders in assessment process
  - id: RAP-HIGH-003
    signal: No linkage between risks and controls
    explanation: Without linkage, control coverage cannot be assessed
    remediation: Map risks to mitigating controls
  medium:
  - id: RAP-MED-001
    signal: Risk appetite not defined
    remediation: Define risk appetite and tolerance levels
  - id: RAP-MED-002
    signal: Assessment results not communicated
    remediation: Implement risk reporting and communication
  low:
  - id: RAP-LOW-001
    signal: Assessment documentation could be improved
  positive:
  - id: RAP-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive risk assessment with stakeholder involvement
  - id: RAP-POS-002
    signal: Clear risk appetite aligned with assessments
