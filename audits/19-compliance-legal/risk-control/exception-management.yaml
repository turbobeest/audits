  what: |
    Evaluates exception management processes including:
    - Exception request and approval workflow
    - Risk acceptance criteria and documentation
    - Exception tracking and expiration
    - Compensating control requirements
    - Exception review and renewal processes
    - Trend analysis and root cause
    - Escalation for high-risk exceptions
    - Communication of exception status
  why_it_matters: |
    Exception management enables business flexibility while
    maintaining risk awareness. Poor exception management leads to:
    - Uncontrolled risk acceptance
    - Exceptions that never expire (permanent gaps)
    - Lack of visibility into compliance posture
    - Audit findings for unmanaged exceptions
    - Inconsistent risk decisions
    - Shadow exceptions outside the process
    - Regulatory concerns about control environment
    Exceptions are acceptable; unmanaged exceptions are not.
  when_to_run:
  - During compliance program reviews
  - Before regulatory examinations
  - When implementing exception processes
  - After exception-related incidents

signals:
  critical:
  - id: EM-CRIT-001
    signal: No formal exception management process
    evidence_indicators:
    - No exception policy or procedure
    - Exceptions granted informally
    - No exception tracking
    explanation: |
      Without formal process, exceptions are uncontrolled risk
      acceptances with no visibility or accountability.
    remediation: Implement formal exception management framework
  - id: EM-CRIT-002
    signal: Exceptions granted without risk assessment
    evidence_indicators:
    - No risk analysis for exceptions
    - Risk of exception not documented
    - Approval without understanding impact
    explanation: |
      Exceptions without risk assessment are uninformed risk
      acceptance decisions that may expose the organization.
    remediation: Require risk assessment for all exception requests
  - id: EM-CRIT-003
    signal: High-risk exceptions without executive approval
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical exceptions approved at low levels
    - No escalation for significant exceptions
    - Risk owners not appropriate for risk level
    explanation: |
      High-risk exceptions require appropriate authority.
      Low-level approval for significant risk is a control failure.
    remediation: Implement tiered approval based on risk level
  high:
  - id: EM-HIGH-001
    signal: Expired exceptions not addressed
    explanation: Expired exceptions should be remediated or renewed
    remediation: Implement exception expiration enforcement
  - id: EM-HIGH-002
    signal: No compensating controls for exceptions
    explanation: Exceptions should have compensating controls where possible
    remediation: Require compensating controls as part of exception approval
  - id: EM-HIGH-003
    signal: Exception trends not analyzed
    explanation: Trend analysis identifies systemic issues
    remediation: Implement exception trend analysis and reporting
  medium:
  - id: EM-MED-001
    signal: Exception documentation incomplete
    remediation: Standardize exception documentation requirements
  - id: EM-MED-002
    signal: Exception review not performed regularly
    remediation: Implement periodic exception review process
  low:
  - id: EM-LOW-001
    signal: Exception process could be more efficient
  positive:
  - id: EM-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive exception management with regular review
  - id: EM-POS-002
