  what: |
    Evaluates accessibility statements and conformance documentation
    including:
    - Statement completeness and accuracy
    - Conformance level claims verification
    - Known limitations disclosure
    - Feedback mechanism availability
    - Contact information for accessibility issues
    - Alternative access information
    - Remediation timeline commitments
    - Compliance with statement requirements (EU, ADA, etc.)

  why_it_matters: |
    Accessibility statements serve multiple important purposes:
    - Legal requirement in EU (Web Accessibility Directive)
    - Demonstrates good faith effort under ADA
    - Sets user expectations for accessibility support
    - Provides accountability for accessibility commitments
    - Reduces legal risk through transparency
    - Enables users to request accommodations
    - Documents compliance status for auditors
    Inaccurate or missing statements increase legal exposure.

  when_to_run:
    - "Before public launch"
    - "When updating accessibility status"
    - "During compliance audits"
    - "After accessibility remediation"

        - "Claims WCAG conformance but testing shows failures"
        - "States 'fully accessible' with known barriers"
        - "No evidence supports conformance claims"
      explanation: |
        False accessibility claims create legal liability and
        mislead users with disabilities who rely on accurate information.
      remediation: "Update statement to accurately reflect actual conformance level"

    - id: "AS-CRIT-002"
      signal: "No accessibility statement exists"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "No accessibility page or statement"
        - "No contact information for accessibility issues"
        - "No conformance information available"
      explanation: |
        Accessibility statement is legally required in EU and
        demonstrates good faith compliance effort globally.
      remediation: "Create comprehensive accessibility statement"

    - id: "AS-CRIT-003"

        - "Feedback not monitored or actioned"
      explanation: |
        Users must be able to report accessibility barriers and
        request accommodations. This is legally required in many jurisdictions.
