  what: |
    Evaluates compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
    (WCAG) including:
    - Perceivable content (text alternatives, captions, adaptable content)
    - Operable interfaces (keyboard accessibility, timing, navigation)
    - Understandable content (readable, predictable, input assistance)
    - Robust implementation (compatibility with assistive technologies)
    - WCAG 2.1 Level A, AA, and AAA success criteria
    - Mobile accessibility considerations
    - PDF and document accessibility
  why_it_matters: |
    WCAG compliance is both a legal requirement and ethical imperative.
    Non-compliance results in:
    - Legal liability under ADA, Section 508, and international laws
    - Lawsuits and settlement costs (averaging $75K-150K)
    - Exclusion of users with disabilities (15-20% of population)
    - Lost market opportunity
    - Reputational damage
    - SEO penalties (accessibility affects search ranking)
    - Government contract ineligibility
  when_to_run:
  - Before public launch of digital products
  - During annual accessibility audits
  - After major UI/UX changes
  - When entering regulated markets

signals:
  critical:
  - id: WCAG-CRIT-001
    signal: Images without text alternatives
    evidence_pattern: <img[^>]*(?!alt=)
    explanation: |
      WCAG 1.1.1 requires text alternatives for non-text content.
      Missing alt text makes images inaccessible to screen reader users.
    remediation: Add descriptive alt text to all images; use empty alt for decorative images
  - id: WCAG-CRIT-002
    signal: Interactive elements not keyboard accessible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Custom controls without keyboard support
    - Click handlers without keyboard equivalents
    - Focus traps without escape
    explanation: |
      WCAG 2.1.1 requires all functionality available via keyboard.
      Non-keyboard accessible content excludes many users.
    remediation: Implement keyboard handlers for all interactive elements
  - id: WCAG-CRIT-003
    signal: No mechanism to skip repetitive content
    evidence_indicators:
    - No skip navigation links
    - No landmark regions
    - No heading structure
    explanation: |
      WCAG 2.4.1 requires mechanisms to bypass repetitive content.
      Screen reader users must navigate through all content otherwise.
    remediation: Add skip links and proper landmark/heading structure
  high:
  - id: WCAG-HIGH-001
    signal: Insufficient color contrast
    explanation: WCAG 1.4.3 requires 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
    remediation: Adjust colors to meet minimum contrast ratios
  - id: WCAG-HIGH-002
    signal: Forms without proper labels
    explanation: WCAG 1.3.1 requires form controls to have associated labels
    remediation: Add visible labels or aria-label to all form controls
  - id: WCAG-HIGH-003
    signal: Video without captions
    explanation: WCAG 1.2.2 requires captions for prerecorded audio content
    remediation: Add synchronized captions to all video content
  medium:
  - id: WCAG-MED-001
    signal: Missing heading hierarchy
    remediation: Implement logical heading structure (h1-h6)
  - id: WCAG-MED-002
    signal: Link text not descriptive
    remediation: Replace generic link text with descriptive alternatives
  - id: WCAG-MED-003
    signal: No visible focus indicators
    remediation: Ensure visible focus states for all interactive elements
  low:
  - id: WCAG-LOW-001
    signal: Missing language attribute
  positive:
  - id: WCAG-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive ARIA implementation
  - id: WCAG-POS-002
