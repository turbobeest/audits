    signal: Web content fails WCAG 2.1 Level AA
    evidence_indicators:
    - WCAG 2.1 Level A or AA failures
    - Critical functionality inaccessible
    - No keyboard access to essential features
    explanation: |
      EN 301 549 incorporates WCAG 2.1 Level AA for web content.
      Non-conformance blocks EU public procurement eligibility.
    remediation: Achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance for all web content
