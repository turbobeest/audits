signals:
  critical:
  - id: 508-CRIT-001
    signal: Product fails WCAG 2.0 Level A criteria
    evidence_indicators:
    - Missing text alternatives
    - Keyboard inaccessible content
    - No captions for multimedia
    explanation: |
      Section 508 incorporates WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA by reference.
      Level A failures are blocking for federal procurement.
    remediation: Remediate all Level A failures before federal submission
  - id: 508-CRIT-002
    signal: Documentation not available in accessible format
    evidence_indicators:
    - PDFs not tagged for accessibility
    - No alternative formats available
    - Help content inaccessible
    explanation: |
      Section 508 requires accessible documentation and support.
      Inaccessible documentation creates compliance failure.
    remediation: Provide accessible formats for all documentation
  - id: 508-CRIT-003
