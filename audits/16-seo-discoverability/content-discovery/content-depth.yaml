  what: |
    This audit evaluates content depth and comprehensiveness, examining
    topical coverage, word count adequacy, multimedia usage, expert insights,
    supporting evidence, and comparison with competing content. It assesses
    whether content thoroughly addresses user intent and provides complete
    answers to searcher questions.

  why_it_matters: |
    Search engines increasingly favor comprehensive, in-depth content that
    fully satisfies user intent. Shallow content loses rankings to competitors
    offering more complete coverage. Google's Helpful Content system rewards
    content created to help users, not just to rank. Content depth is correlated
    with higher rankings, longer time-on-page, lower bounce rates, and more
    backlinks - all positive SEO signals.

  when_to_run:
    - "When creating new pillar/cornerstone content"
    - "When rankings decline for key pages"
    - "During content gap analysis"
    - "Before major content investments"

signals:
  critical:
    - id: "SEO-DEPTH-CRIT-001"
      signal: "Key pages significantly thinner than top-ranking competitors"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Word count less than 50% of competitor average"
        - "Missing major subtopics competitors cover"
      explanation: |
        When content is significantly thinner than competing pages ranking
        for target keywords, it lacks the comprehensiveness search engines
        expect and users need. This is a primary cause of ranking losses.
      remediation: "Expand content to match or exceed competitor depth with unique value"
    - id: "SEO-DEPTH-CRIT-002"
      signal: "Content fails to address primary user intent"
      evidence_pattern: "High bounce rate combined with low time-on-page"
      explanation: |
        Content that doesn't satisfy user intent will lose rankings as
        Google's user satisfaction signals indicate poor content quality.
      remediation: "Research user intent thoroughly and ensure content fully addresses it"

  high:
    - id: "SEO-DEPTH-HIGH-001"
      signal: "Lack of supporting evidence and data"
      explanation: |
        Content without supporting statistics, studies, or examples lacks
        credibility and depth that builds E-E-A-T signals.
      remediation: "Add relevant statistics, case studies, and expert citations"
    - id: "SEO-DEPTH-HIGH-002"
      signal: "No multimedia supporting text content"
      explanation: |
        Text-only content misses opportunities for visual explanation,
        increased engagement, and additional ranking opportunities (image search).
      remediation: "Add relevant images, videos, infographics, or interactive elements"

  medium:
    - id: "SEO-DEPTH-MED-001"
      signal: "Shallow heading structure (H2 only)"
      remediation: "Create deeper hierarchy with H3/H4 for subtopics"
    - id: "SEO-DEPTH-MED-002"
      signal: "Missing FAQ or common questions section"
      remediation: "Add FAQ section addressing related searches"

  low:
    - id: "SEO-DEPTH-LOW-001"
      signal: "No table of contents for long-form content"

  positive:
    - id: "SEO-DEPTH-POS-001"
