  what: |
    This audit evaluates the quality and regional relevance of localized
    content across different language and regional versions. It examines
    translation quality, cultural adaptation, regional keyword optimization,
    local terminology usage, currency/unit localization, and content
    parity between regional versions.

  why_it_matters: |
    High-quality regional content is essential for international SEO success.
    Poorly translated or culturally inappropriate content leads to high bounce
    rates, low engagement, and poor conversion rates in international markets.
    Search engines can detect low-quality translations and may rank
    competitors with better localized content higher. Regional content quality
    directly impacts trust, brand perception, and revenue in international markets.

  when_to_run:
    - "After content localization projects"
    - "When regional engagement metrics decline"
    - "When expanding to new markets"
    - "During quarterly international content reviews"

signals:
  critical:
    - id: "SEO-REGCON-CRIT-001"
      signal: "Machine translation without human review"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Unnatural phrasing patterns"
        - "Incorrect gender/number agreement"
        - "Literal translation of idioms"
      explanation: |
        Unreviewed machine translation creates poor user experience and
        can damage brand reputation. Search engines may recognize low-quality
        content and rank it lower. Users quickly bounce from poorly translated pages.
      remediation: "Implement professional translation with native speaker review"
    - id: "SEO-REGCON-CRIT-002"
      signal: "Critical content missing from regional versions"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Empty or placeholder content in regional pages"
        - "Significant content gaps vs source language"
      explanation: |
        Missing content in regional versions provides poor user experience
        and signals to search engines that the regional version is incomplete.
      remediation: "Ensure full content parity across all regional versions"

  high:
    - id: "SEO-REGCON-HIGH-001"
      signal: "Regional keywords not optimized"
      explanation: |
        Using translated keywords rather than locally-researched keywords
        misses how regional users actually search, reducing visibility.
      remediation: "Conduct regional keyword research and optimize content accordingly"
    - id: "SEO-REGCON-HIGH-002"
      signal: "Cultural misalignment in content"
      explanation: |
        Content that doesn't resonate culturally (wrong references, imagery,
        examples) reduces engagement and trust with regional audiences.
      remediation: "Adapt content culturally, not just linguistically"

  medium:
    - id: "SEO-REGCON-MED-001"
      signal: "Inconsistent currency/unit localization"
      remediation: "Localize all currencies, units, and date formats for each region"
    - id: "SEO-REGCON-MED-002"
      signal: "Untranslated UI elements"
      remediation: "Ensure all UI elements, buttons, and navigation are translated"
