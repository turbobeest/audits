  what: |
    This audit evaluates content quality factors that influence SEO
    performance and user engagement. It assesses content depth and
    comprehensiveness, originality (duplicate content detection),
    readability metrics, E-E-A-T signals, content freshness, multimedia
    integration, and alignment with search intent for target queries.

  why_it_matters: |
    Google's core ranking systems heavily weight content quality through
    the Helpful Content System. Thin, duplicate, or low-quality content
    can trigger site-wide ranking suppression. High-quality content that
    demonstrates expertise and satisfies user intent ranks better, earns
    more backlinks, and generates higher engagement and conversions.

  when_to_run:
    - "Before publishing new content"
    - "During content audits"
    - "After Google algorithm updates"
    - "When rankings drop across multiple pages"
    - "During competitor content analysis"

signals:
  critical:
    - id: "CONTENT-CRIT-001"
      signal: "Duplicate content detected across multiple pages"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Same content on multiple URLs"
        - "High similarity scores between pages"
      explanation: |
        Duplicate content wastes crawl budget, dilutes ranking signals,
        and may trigger penalties if perceived as manipulative.
      remediation: "Consolidate duplicates, use canonicals, or rewrite content"

    - id: "CONTENT-CRIT-002"
      signal: "Thin content pages (under 300 words for substantive topics)"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Word count < 300"
        - "Topic requires more depth"
      explanation: |
        Thin content often fails to satisfy user intent and signals
        low quality to search engines. The Helpful Content System may
        suppress rankings site-wide if thin content is prevalent.
      remediation: "Expand content depth or consolidate with related pages"

  high:
    - id: "CONTENT-HIGH-001"
      signal: "No E-E-A-T signals (author, credentials, sources)"
      explanation: |
        For YMYL (Your Money Your Life) topics especially, lack of
        author attribution and expertise signals can significantly
        hurt rankings.
      remediation: "Add author bios, credentials, sources, and citations"

    - id: "CONTENT-HIGH-002"
      signal: "Outdated content with stale information"
      explanation: |
        Content with outdated information reduces trustworthiness
        and may provide inaccurate information to users.
      remediation: "Update content with current information and refresh dates"

    - id: "CONTENT-HIGH-003"
      signal: "Content doesn't match search intent"
      explanation: |
        If content format or depth doesn't match what users expect
        for target queries, engagement suffers and rankings decline.
      remediation: "Analyze SERP for target query and align content format"

  medium:
    - id: "CONTENT-MED-001"
      signal: "Poor readability (Flesch-Kincaid grade >12)"
      remediation: "Simplify language for target audience"

    - id: "CONTENT-MED-002"
      signal: "No multimedia (images, videos, infographics)"
      remediation: "Add relevant visual content to enhance engagement"

    - id: "CONTENT-MED-003"
      signal: "No internal links to related content"
      remediation: "Add contextual internal links to relevant pages"

  low:
