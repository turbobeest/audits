  what: |
    This audit examines meta description tags across the website for
    optimization. It evaluates description length (120-160 characters
    optimal), uniqueness across pages, call-to-action inclusion,
    keyword usage, and compelling copy that encourages clicks.
    While not a direct ranking factor, meta descriptions significantly
    impact click-through rates from search results.
  why_it_matters: |
    Meta descriptions appear as the snippet text in search results,
    directly influencing whether users click on your result. Well-crafted
    descriptions with clear value propositions and calls-to-action can
    significantly improve CTR. Poor or missing descriptions result in
    Google auto-generating snippets, often with suboptimal text.
  when_to_run:
  - When creating new pages or content
  - During click-through rate optimization
  - After site migrations
  - Quarterly on-page SEO audits
  - When SERP CTR is below expectations

signals:
  critical:
  - id: META-CRIT-001
    signal: Missing meta descriptions on high-traffic pages
    evidence_pattern: No meta description tag found
    explanation: |
      Pages without meta descriptions rely on Google to generate
      snippets, often resulting in poor or irrelevant text that
      reduces click-through rates.
    remediation: Add compelling meta descriptions to all important pages
  high:
  - id: META-HIGH-001
    signal: Duplicate meta descriptions across multiple pages
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same description on multiple URLs
    - '>5% of pages share identical descriptions'
    explanation: |
      Duplicate descriptions miss the opportunity to highlight
      unique content on each page and may confuse users.
    remediation: Create unique, page-specific descriptions
  - id: META-HIGH-002
    signal: Meta descriptions significantly too long (>170 characters)
    explanation: |
      Long descriptions are truncated in search results with "..."
      potentially cutting off calls-to-action or key information.
    remediation: Shorten descriptions to 120-160 characters
  medium:
  - id: META-MED-001
    signal: Meta descriptions too short (<70 characters)
    remediation: Expand descriptions to fully utilize available space
  - id: META-MED-002
    signal: Missing call-to-action in descriptions
    remediation: Include action words like 'Learn', 'Discover', 'Get'
  - id: META-MED-003
    signal: Descriptions not matching page content
    remediation: Rewrite descriptions to accurately summarize page content
  low:
  - id: META-LOW-001
    signal: Special characters or quotes in descriptions
  - id: META-LOW-002
    signal: No keyword inclusion in descriptions
  positive:
  - id: META-POS-001
    signal: All pages have unique, compelling meta descriptions
