  what: |
    This audit examines HTML title tags across the website for SEO
    optimization. It evaluates title length (50-60 characters optimal),
    uniqueness across pages, keyword placement, brand consistency,
    clickability for search results, and proper HTML implementation.
    Title tags are one of the most important on-page SEO elements.
  why_it_matters: |
    Title tags are the primary text displayed in search engine results
    and browser tabs. They directly influence click-through rates and
    are a significant ranking factor. Poorly optimized titles (too long,
    missing keywords, duplicates) reduce search visibility and traffic.
    Compelling, well-structured titles improve both rankings and clicks.
  when_to_run:
  - When creating new pages or content
  - During content optimization campaigns
  - After site migrations
  - Quarterly on-page SEO audits
  - When click-through rates are declining

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TITLE-CRIT-001
    signal: Missing title tags on important pages
    evidence_pattern: No <title> tag found
    explanation: |
      Pages without title tags have no control over how they appear
      in search results. Google may generate a title, often poorly.
    remediation: Add unique, descriptive title tags to all pages
  - id: TITLE-CRIT-002
    signal: Duplicate title tags across multiple pages
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same title on multiple URLs
    - '>2% of pages share identical titles'
    explanation: |
      Duplicate titles make it difficult for search engines to
      differentiate pages and for users to identify the right result.
    remediation: Create unique titles for each page
  high:
  - id: TITLE-HIGH-001
    signal: Title tags significantly too long (>70 characters)
    explanation: |
      Long titles are truncated in search results, potentially
      cutting off important information and reducing click appeal.
    remediation: Shorten titles to 50-60 characters
  - id: TITLE-HIGH-002
    signal: Title tags missing primary target keywords
    explanation: |
      Title tags are a strong ranking signal. Missing relevant
      keywords reduces the page's ability to rank for target terms.
    remediation: Include primary keyword near the beginning of title
  medium:
  - id: TITLE-MED-001
    signal: Title tags too short (<30 characters)
    remediation: Expand titles with descriptive, keyword-rich content
  - id: TITLE-MED-002
    signal: Brand name not included consistently
    remediation: 'Add brand name to titles (typically at end: | Brand)'
  - id: TITLE-MED-003
    signal: Keyword stuffing in title tags
    remediation: Use natural language, include 1-2 keywords maximum
  low:
  - id: TITLE-LOW-001
    signal: Special characters that may display incorrectly
  - id: TITLE-LOW-002
    signal: Title case vs sentence case inconsistency
  positive:
  - id: TITLE-POS-001
    signal: All pages have unique, optimized title tags
  - id: TITLE-POS-002
    signal: Titles within optimal 50-60 character length
