  what: |
    This audit evaluates Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business)
    optimization for local search visibility. It examines profile completeness,
    category selection, NAP accuracy, photos, posts, Q&A, reviews, attributes,
    and Google's local pack ranking factors to maximize local search presence.
  why_it_matters: |
    Google Business Profile is the most important factor for local pack
    rankings - the prominent map results shown for local searches. An
    optimized GBP can dramatically increase local visibility, phone calls,
    website clicks, and in-store visits. 46% of Google searches have local
    intent, and businesses in the local pack receive the majority of clicks.
    GBP is also critical for voice search results.
  when_to_run:
  - When launching a new business location
  - When local search visibility declines
  - Quarterly local SEO reviews
  - Before local marketing campaigns

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SEO-GBP-CRIT-001
    signal: Google Business Profile not claimed or verified
    evidence_indicators:
    - No verified GBP listing
    - Unclaimed listing with incorrect information
    explanation: |
      Without a claimed and verified GBP, the business cannot control
      its listing information, respond to reviews, or optimize for
      local search. This is the foundation of local SEO.
    remediation: Claim and verify Google Business Profile immediately
  - id: SEO-GBP-CRIT-002
    signal: NAP information inconsistent with website
    evidence_pattern: GBP name/address/phone differs from website
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent NAP between GBP and website confuses Google and
      reduces local ranking signals. NAP must be identical across
      all platforms.
    remediation: Ensure GBP NAP exactly matches website and all citations
  high:
  - id: SEO-GBP-HIGH-001
    signal: Incorrect primary category
    explanation: |
      The primary category is the most important ranking factor you
      control. The wrong category reduces visibility for relevant
      searches.
    remediation: Select the most specific, accurate primary category
  - id: SEO-GBP-HIGH-002
    signal: No photos or outdated photos
    explanation: |
      Businesses with photos receive 42% more requests for directions
      and 35% more website clicks. Photos build trust and engagement.
    remediation: Add high-quality photos of exterior, interior, products, team
  medium:
  - id: SEO-GBP-MED-001
    signal: Business description not optimized
    remediation: Write compelling description with relevant keywords (750 chars)
