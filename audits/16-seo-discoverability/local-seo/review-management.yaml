  what: |
    This audit evaluates online review management practices across Google,
    Yelp, Facebook, and industry-specific review platforms. It examines
    review quantity, rating trends, response practices, sentiment analysis,
    review generation strategies, and policy compliance to optimize local
    search rankings and reputation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Reviews are a significant local ranking factor and heavily influence
    consumer decisions. 93% of consumers read online reviews before
    purchasing. Review quantity, velocity, diversity, and ratings all
    impact local pack rankings. Review response signals engagement and
    customer service quality. Poor review management directly impacts both
    rankings and conversion rates.
  when_to_run:
  - Monthly reputation monitoring
  - After negative review situations
  - Before local marketing campaigns
  - During competitive analysis

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SEO-REV-CRIT-001
    signal: Google rating below 4.0 stars
    evidence_threshold: GBP rating < 4.0
    explanation: |
      Google ratings below 4.0 significantly reduce click-through rates
      and may impact local pack inclusion. Most consumers filter for
      4+ star businesses.
    remediation: Implement review recovery strategy, address service issues
  - id: SEO-REV-CRIT-002
    signal: No review response strategy
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reviews go unanswered
    - No response to negative reviews
    explanation: |
      Failing to respond to reviews, especially negative ones, signals
      poor customer service and missed recovery opportunities. Google
      considers review response as an engagement signal.
    remediation: Implement review response policy with 24-48 hour SLA
  high:
  - id: SEO-REV-HIGH-001
    signal: Review count significantly lower than competitors
    explanation: |
      Review quantity is a ranking factor. Having fewer reviews than
      competitors puts the business at a disadvantage in local pack.
    remediation: Implement ethical review generation program
  - id: SEO-REV-HIGH-002
    signal: Negative review trend increasing
    explanation: |
      A trend of increasing negative reviews signals service decline
      and will impact both rankings and conversions.
    remediation: Analyze negative feedback, address root causes, respond professionally
  medium:
  - id: SEO-REV-MED-001
    signal: Reviews concentrated on single platform
    remediation: Diversify review generation across multiple platforms
