  what: |
    This audit evaluates local business citations - mentions of business
    name, address, and phone (NAP) across directories, review sites, social
    platforms, and industry-specific listings. It assesses citation quantity,
    accuracy, consistency, and coverage on key platforms critical for local
    search rankings.
  why_it_matters: |
    Citations are a foundational local ranking factor. Consistent citations
    across authoritative directories validate business information to search
    engines and increase local visibility. Inconsistent or inaccurate citations
    confuse search engines and users, potentially harming local rankings.
    Citation building remains one of the most effective local SEO strategies.
  when_to_run:
  - When setting up local SEO
  - After address or phone changes
  - When local rankings decline
  - Quarterly citation health checks

      Search queries for citation discovery:
      - "Business Name" + city
      - "Business Name" + phone
      - "Business Address"
      - "Phone Number" (quoted)

      Check these major directories:
      - Google Business Profile
      - Facebook
      - Apple Maps
      - Bing Places
      - Yelp
      - Yellow Pages
      - BBB

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SEO-CIT-CRIT-001
    signal: Major citation inconsistencies
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different business names across citations
    - Old addresses still listed
    - Wrong phone numbers
    explanation: |
      Significant NAP inconsistencies across citations confuse search
      engines and users, potentially causing them to contact wrong
      locations or lose trust in the business.
    remediation: Correct all citations to match canonical NAP format
  - id: SEO-CIT-CRIT-002
    signal: Missing from major data aggregators
    evidence_pattern: No listing on Foursquare, Data Axle, Localeze, Infogroup
