  what: |
    This audit evaluates the quality, relevance, and authority of backlinks
    pointing to the website. It examines referring domain authority, link
    relevance, anchor text distribution, link velocity, toxic link identification,
    and competitive backlink gap analysis to assess off-page SEO strength.
  why_it_matters: |
    Backlinks remain one of Google's most important ranking factors. However,
    link quality matters far more than quantity - a few high-authority, relevant
    links outweigh hundreds of low-quality links. Toxic or spammy backlinks
    can trigger algorithmic penalties or manual actions. Understanding backlink
    profile strength relative to competitors is essential for SEO strategy
    and identifying link building opportunities.
  when_to_run:
  - During competitive SEO analysis
  - After link building campaigns
  - When rankings drop suddenly (possible penalty)
  - Quarterly backlink health checks

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SEO-BLINK-CRIT-001
    signal: High volume of toxic/spammy backlinks
    evidence_threshold: Toxic score > 50 or significant spam link volume
    explanation: |
      A high concentration of toxic backlinks from spam sites, PBNs, or
      link schemes can trigger Google penalties. These links provide no
      value and may harm rankings across the entire site.
    remediation: Disavow toxic links through Google Disavow Tool, monitor for new spam
  - id: SEO-BLINK-CRIT-002
    signal: Sudden large backlink loss
    evidence_pattern: Significant drop in referring domains
    explanation: |
      Rapid loss of backlinks (from site redesigns, expired links, or
      link removals) can cause ranking drops as authority signals decrease.
    remediation: Investigate cause, reclaim lost links, accelerate link building
  high:
  - id: SEO-BLINK-HIGH-001
    signal: Competitor backlink gap significantly negative
    explanation: |
      When competitors have substantially more quality backlinks from
      authoritative sources, it's difficult to compete for rankings.
    remediation: Develop link building strategy targeting competitor link sources
  - id: SEO-BLINK-HIGH-002
    signal: Unnatural anchor text distribution
    explanation: |
      Over-optimized anchor text (too many exact-match keyword anchors)
      can signal manipulation and trigger algorithmic penalties.
    remediation: Diversify anchor text with natural variations, branded anchors
  medium:
  - id: SEO-BLINK-MED-001
    signal: Low referring domain diversity
    remediation: Focus on acquiring links from diverse, relevant domains
  - id: SEO-BLINK-MED-002
    signal: Majority of links from low-authority sites
    remediation: Prioritize quality over quantity in link building
  low:
  - id: SEO-BLINK-LOW-001
    signal: Limited .edu and .gov backlinks
  positive:
  - id: SEO-BLINK-POS-001
    signal: Strong backlink profile from relevant, authoritative sites
  - id: SEO-BLINK-POS-002
    signal: Natural anchor text distribution
