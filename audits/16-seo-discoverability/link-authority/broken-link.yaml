  what: |
    This audit identifies broken links (404 errors) on the website including
    internal links pointing to non-existent pages, external links to dead
    resources, and broken image/resource references. It also identifies
    soft 404s (pages that return 200 but are effectively error pages).
  why_it_matters: |
    Broken links create poor user experience, causing frustration when users
    click expecting content and find nothing. They waste link equity that
    could flow to live pages. Search engines view excessive broken links as
    a sign of poor site maintenance, which can affect quality assessment.
    Broken external links to your site (lost backlinks) waste acquired authority.
  when_to_run:
  - After site migrations or redesigns
  - During regular site maintenance
  - When 404 errors increase in analytics
  - Monthly link health checks

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SEO-BROK-CRIT-001
    signal: Internal links returning 404 errors
    evidence_pattern: Internal URLs returning HTTP 404
    explanation: |
      Internal 404s waste link equity, frustrate users, and indicate
      site maintenance issues. Every internal 404 is a missed opportunity
      to direct users and link equity to valuable content.
    remediation: Fix or redirect broken internal links to relevant pages
  - id: SEO-BROK-CRIT-002
    signal: Soft 404s detected
    evidence_pattern: Pages returning 200 but displaying error content
    explanation: |
      Soft 404s confuse search engines because they don't signal a true
      error. Google may still try to index these pages, wasting crawl budget.
    remediation: Return proper 404 status code for error pages
  high:
  - id: SEO-BROK-HIGH-001
    signal: High-authority pages with broken links
    explanation: |
      Broken links on high-traffic or high-authority pages have greater
      impact on user experience and link equity waste.
    remediation: Prioritize fixing broken links on high-value pages
  - id: SEO-BROK-HIGH-002
    signal: Broken external links damaging credibility
    explanation: |
      Outbound links to dead resources harm credibility and user experience,
      suggesting outdated or poorly maintained content.
    remediation: Update or remove broken external links
  medium:
  - id: SEO-BROK-MED-001
    signal: Broken image links
    remediation: Fix or remove broken image references
  - id: SEO-BROK-MED-002
    signal: Links to redirected URLs
    remediation: Update links to point directly to final destination
  low:
  - id: SEO-BROK-LOW-001
    signal: Minor broken links in archived content
  positive:
  - id: SEO-BROK-POS-001
    signal: Zero internal 404 errors
  - id: SEO-BROK-POS-002
    signal: Regular broken link monitoring in place
