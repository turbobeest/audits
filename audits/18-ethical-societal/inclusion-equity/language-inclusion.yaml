  what: |
    Examines the language accessibility of a product or service, assessing:
    - Number and selection of supported languages
    - Translation quality and cultural appropriateness
    - Right-to-left (RTL) language support
    - Support for non-Latin character sets
    - Language detection and switching mechanisms
    - Accessibility of language settings
    - Consistency of translations across features
    - Support for language variants and dialects
  why_it_matters: |
    Language barriers are among the most significant obstacles to digital
    inclusion:
    - 75% of internet users speak a language other than English as primary
    - Poor translations or missing languages exclude entire populations
    - RTL language issues make products unusable for Arabic, Hebrew speakers
    - Machine translations without review can be offensive or confusing
    - Language-only content excludes users with low literacy in any language

    Comprehensive language support demonstrates commitment to global
    accessibility and enables broader market reach.

signals:
  critical:
  - id: LANG-CRIT-001
    signal: No internationalization framework implemented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Hardcoded strings throughout codebase
    - No translation files present
    - No i18n library in dependencies
    explanation: |
      Without an i18n framework, adding language support requires
      significant refactoring, leaving the product inaccessible
      to non-English speakers.
    remediation: Implement an i18n framework and externalize all user-facing strings
  - id: LANG-CRIT-002
    signal: RTL languages claimed as supported but broken
    evidence_indicators:
    - Text displays backwards in RTL mode
    - Layout does not mirror for RTL
    - Mixed LTR/RTL text not handled
    explanation: |
      Broken RTL support makes the product unusable for Arabic,
      Hebrew, Persian, and Urdu speakers among others.
    remediation: Implement proper RTL support with directional CSS and text handling
  high:
  - id: LANG-HIGH-001
    signal: Translation coverage varies significantly between languages
    explanation: |
      When some languages have complete translations and others
      have significant gaps, it creates second-class user experiences.
    remediation: Ensure consistent translation coverage across all supported languages
  - id: LANG-HIGH-002
    signal: Machine translations published without human review
    explanation: |
      Unreviewed machine translations often contain errors, awkward
      phrasing, or culturally inappropriate content.
    remediation: Implement human review for all machine-translated content
  - id: LANG-HIGH-003
    signal: Character encoding issues with non-Latin scripts
    explanation: |
      Encoding problems make content unreadable for users of
      many major languages including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic.
    remediation: Ensure UTF-8 encoding throughout the application stack
  medium:
  - id: LANG-MED-001
    signal: Language switching difficult to find or use
    remediation: Make language selection prominent and accessible from all pages
  - id: LANG-MED-002
    signal: No support for language variants (e.g., pt-BR vs pt-PT)
    remediation: Support major language variants where vocabulary differs significantly
  - id: LANG-MED-003
    signal: UI text truncation in some languages
    remediation: Design flexible layouts that accommodate text expansion
  low:
  - id: LANG-LOW-001
