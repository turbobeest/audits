  what: |
    Examines how diverse populations are represented within a product
    or service, assessing:
    - Diversity in stock imagery and illustrations
    - Inclusivity of example names, personas, and sample data
    - Representation in marketing and promotional materials
    - Diversity of voices in testimonials and case studies
    - Avatar and profile customization options
    - Default assumptions in forms and workflows
    - Representation in documentation and tutorials
    - Inclusive language and terminology throughout
  why_it_matters: |
    Representation matters for product adoption, user trust, and
    social responsibility:
    - Users who don't see themselves reflected may feel excluded
    - Homogeneous representation reinforces societal biases
    - Default assumptions can alienate users (e.g., gendered honorifics)
    - Lack of diverse testing leads to blind spots in product design
    - Representation affects brand perception and market reach
    - Poor representation can cause reputational and legal risks

    Inclusive representation signals that a product values all users
    and has considered diverse perspectives in its design.
  when_to_run:
  - During content and design reviews
  - Before major marketing campaigns

signals:
  critical:
  - id: REP-CRIT-001
    signal: Imagery exclusively represents one demographic group
    evidence_indicators:
    - All human images show same ethnicity
    - Only one gender represented in professional roles
    - No representation of people with disabilities
    explanation: |
      Homogeneous representation signals that the product is not
      designed for diverse users and can alienate significant
      portions of the potential user base.
    remediation: Diversify imagery to represent varied ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities
  - id: REP-CRIT-002
    signal: Default options enforce harmful stereotypes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Gendered defaults in non-relevant contexts
    - Stereotypical role assumptions
    - Culturally insensitive default content
    explanation: |
      Default assumptions that enforce stereotypes can alienate
      users and contribute to broader societal bias reinforcement.
    remediation: Review and neutralize default options; avoid stereotypical assumptions
  high:
  - id: REP-HIGH-001
    signal: Sample names and examples lack cultural diversity
    explanation: |
      Using only Western names in examples signals a narrow
      design perspective and can make the product feel foreign
      to users from other cultural backgrounds.
    remediation: Use culturally diverse names in examples and sample data
  - id: REP-HIGH-002
    signal: Limited avatar or profile customization options
    explanation: |
      When users cannot create avatars that represent them,
      it signals the product was not designed with them in mind.
    remediation: Provide diverse skin tones, hairstyles, and customization options
  medium:
  - id: REP-MED-001
    signal: Testimonials and case studies lack diversity
    remediation: Actively seek diverse voices for testimonials and case studies
  - id: REP-MED-002
    signal: Documentation uses gendered pronouns unnecessarily
    remediation: Use gender-neutral language in documentation
  - id: REP-MED-003
    signal: Limited honorific or title options in forms
    remediation: Provide inclusive honorific options or make optional
  low:
  - id: REP-LOW-001
    signal: Holiday or cultural references primarily Western
