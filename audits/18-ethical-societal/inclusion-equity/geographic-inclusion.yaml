  what: |
    Examines how well a technology product or service accommodates
    users across different geographic regions, assessing:
    - Service availability by country and region
    - Infrastructure dependencies (CDN coverage, data centers)
    - Latency and performance across regions
    - Compliance with local regulations
    - Localization beyond language (date formats, currencies, addresses)
    - Feature parity across regions
    - Rural vs. urban access considerations
  why_it_matters: |
    Geographic limitations in technology services create digital exclusion
    and can reinforce global inequalities:
    - Users in certain regions may be completely blocked from services
    - Poor performance in some areas creates second-class user experiences
    - Lack of localization signals that some markets are not valued
    - Regulatory non-compliance can expose users to legal risks
    - Urban-centric design neglects rural populations globally

    Geographic inclusion enables global reach and demonstrates commitment
    to serving diverse user populations equitably.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching in new geographic markets
  - When expanding service coverage
  - During global accessibility reviews
  - When infrastructure changes affect regional availability

signals:
  critical:
  - id: GEO-CRIT-001
    signal: Entire regions blocked without clear justification
    evidence_indicators:
    - Country-level IP blocking
    - No service availability in major regions
    - Blanket geographic restrictions
    explanation: |
      Blocking entire regions without legal or technical necessity
      excludes large populations and may constitute discrimination.
    remediation: Review and justify all geographic restrictions; remove unjustified blocks
  - id: GEO-CRIT-002
    signal: No CDN or edge presence in served regions
    evidence_indicators:
    - All traffic routes through single region
    - 500ms+ latency for significant user population
    - No local caching for static assets
    explanation: |
      Users in regions far from infrastructure experience degraded
      service, creating inequitable access despite official availability.
    remediation: Deploy CDN edges or caching proxies in underserved regions
  high:
  - id: GEO-HIGH-001
    signal: Feature parity issues between regions
    explanation: |
      When certain features are available in some regions but not
      others without clear necessity, it creates second-class users.
    remediation: Ensure feature parity or clearly communicate regional differences
  - id: GEO-HIGH-002
    signal: No localization for address, phone, or date formats
    explanation: |
      Forcing users to enter data in foreign formats creates friction
      and errors, particularly affecting non-Western regions.
    remediation: Implement proper locale-aware formatting for all user inputs
  medium:
  - id: GEO-MED-001
    signal: Currency options limited to major currencies
    remediation: Support local currencies for pricing and transactions
  - id: GEO-MED-002
    signal: Rural users experience significantly worse performance
    remediation: Optimize for users outside major metropolitan areas
  low:
  - id: GEO-LOW-001
    signal: Time zone handling requires manual user selection
  positive:
  - id: GEO-POS-001
    signal: Global CDN coverage with edge locations on all continents
  - id: GEO-POS-002
    signal: Complete locale support including address and date formats
  - id: GEO-POS-003
