  what: |
    Assesses how well a product or service accommodates users with
    varying economic means, examining:
    - Pricing structures and tier accessibility
    - Free tier functionality and limitations
    - Payment method inclusivity
    - Cost transparency and predictability
    - Affordability relative to target markets
    - Financial barriers to essential features

    Reviews pricing models, payment systems, and feature gating to
    ensure economic circumstances don't create undue barriers to access.
  why_it_matters: |
    Economic barriers to technology access perpetuate inequality and
    exclude large populations from digital participation:
    - Premium-only features may gatekeep essential functionality
    - Complex pricing confuses users and leads to unexpected costs
    - Limited payment options exclude unbanked/underbanked populations
    - Regional pricing that ignores purchasing power parity excludes users
    - Subscription fatigue disproportionately affects lower-income users

    Organizations that prioritize economic accessibility expand their
    addressable market and fulfill social responsibility obligations.
  when_to_run:
  - When designing or revising pricing models
  - Before launching in economically diverse markets
  - During product accessibility reviews
  - When evaluating freemium model effectiveness

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ECON-CRIT-001
    signal: Essential features require paid subscription with no alternatives
    evidence_indicators:
    - Core functionality unavailable in free tier
    - No trial period for paid features
    - Essential accessibility features paywalled
    explanation: |
      When essential features require payment with no alternatives,
      economically disadvantaged users are completely excluded from
      the service, potentially violating accessibility principles.
    remediation: Ensure core functionality is accessible in free tier or provide assistance programs
  - id: ECON-CRIT-002
    signal: Only credit card payments accepted
    evidence_indicators:
    - No alternative payment methods
    - No debit card or prepaid card support
    - No regional payment methods for target markets
    explanation: |
      Credit card-only payment excludes unbanked and underbanked
      populations, which represent significant portions of users
      in many regions globally.
    remediation: Support diverse payment methods including debit, prepaid, mobile payments, and regional
      options
  high:
  - id: ECON-HIGH-001
    signal: No purchasing power parity pricing for international markets
    explanation: |
      Uniform global pricing ignores vast differences in purchasing
      power, making products unaffordable in developing economies.
    remediation: Implement regional pricing based on purchasing power parity
  - id: ECON-HIGH-002
    signal: Hidden fees or unpredictable billing
    explanation: |
      Unexpected costs disproportionately harm users with limited
      financial buffers and erode trust.
    remediation: Ensure complete price transparency with no hidden fees
  medium:
  - id: ECON-MED-001
    signal: No annual billing discount available
    remediation: Offer annual plans with meaningful savings for committed users
  - id: ECON-MED-002
    signal: Free tier limitations overly restrictive
    remediation: Review free tier to ensure meaningful functionality is accessible
  - id: ECON-MED-003
    signal: No student, nonprofit, or education discounts
    remediation: Consider discount programs for price-sensitive user segments
  low:
  - id: ECON-LOW-001
    signal: No family or team plans for shared access
  positive:
  - id: ECON-POS-001
    signal: Robust free tier with genuinely useful functionality
  - id: ECON-POS-002
    signal: Purchasing power parity pricing implemented
  - id: ECON-POS-003
