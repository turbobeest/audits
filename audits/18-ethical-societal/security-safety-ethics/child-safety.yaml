  what: |
    Examines protections for children and minors using digital services,
    assessing:
    - Age verification and age-gating mechanisms
    - COPPA compliance for under-13 data collection
    - Age-appropriate design principles (AADC compliance)
    - Parental consent and control mechanisms
    - Content moderation for child safety
    - CSAM detection and reporting
    - Grooming and predatory behavior prevention
    - Minor-specific privacy protections
    - Child-safe default settings
  why_it_matters: |
    Children face unique risks online and deserve special protections:
    - COPPA violations carry significant FTC penalties
    - UK AADC and state age-appropriate design laws are expanding
    - CSAM is a strict liability offense requiring mandatory reporting
    - Predatory targeting of minors causes severe harm
    - Addictive design impacts developing minds differently
    - Default privacy settings often expose children
    - Parental controls are essential for younger users
    - Regulatory and legal exposure is increasing globally

    Robust child safety protections are both legally required and
    ethically essential.
  when_to_run:
  - When launching services accessible to minors
  - During COPPA/AADC compliance assessments
  - When adding features that could affect child safety
  - Following child safety incidents or complaints

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CHILD-CRIT-001
    signal: Data collected from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent
    evidence_indicators:
    - No age gate on registration
    - No parental consent mechanism
    - Children's data collected and processed
    explanation: |
      COPPA requires verifiable parental consent before collecting
      personal information from children under 13. Violations carry
      significant FTC penalties.
    remediation: Implement age verification and verifiable parental consent for under-13 users
  - id: CHILD-CRIT-002
    signal: No CSAM detection or NCMEC reporting process
    evidence_indicators:
    - No hash-matching for known CSAM
    - No NCMEC CyberTipline reporting
    - User reports not escalated appropriately
    explanation: |
      CSAM is illegal content requiring mandatory reporting. Failure
      to detect and report is a federal offense.
    remediation: Implement CSAM detection and mandatory NCMEC reporting
  - id: CHILD-CRIT-003
    signal: No protections against adult contact with minors
    evidence_indicators:
    - Adults can freely message minors
    - No age-based interaction restrictions
    - No grooming detection or prevention
    explanation: |
      Unprotected adult-minor interactions enable grooming and
      predatory behavior, causing severe harm to children.
    remediation: Implement age-based interaction controls and grooming prevention
  high:
  - id: CHILD-HIGH-001
    signal: Privacy defaults not child-appropriate
    explanation: |
      UK AADC and emerging laws require high privacy by default
      for users likely to be children.
    remediation: Set privacy-protective defaults for accounts identified as minors
  - id: CHILD-HIGH-002
    signal: Age verification easily circumvented
    explanation: |
      Ineffective age verification fails to protect children
      and may not satisfy regulatory requirements.
    remediation: Implement more robust age verification measures
  - id: CHILD-HIGH-003
    signal: Behavioral targeting used on minors
    explanation: |
      Many laws prohibit or restrict profiling and targeted
      advertising to children.
    remediation: Disable behavioral advertising for accounts identified as minors
  medium:
  - id: CHILD-MED-001
    signal: No parental control or supervision features
    remediation: Implement parental oversight and control capabilities
  - id: CHILD-MED-002
    signal: Children's privacy policy section unclear or missing
    remediation: Add clear, COPPA-compliant children's privacy disclosures
  - id: CHILD-MED-003
    signal: Data retention not minimized for children's data
    remediation: Apply strict data minimization for children's personal information
  low:
  - id: CHILD-LOW-001
    signal: No child-specific safety education resources
  positive:
  - id: CHILD-POS-001
    signal: Robust age verification with parental consent flow
  - id: CHILD-POS-002
    signal: CSAM detection and NCMEC reporting implemented
  - id: CHILD-POS-003
    signal: Age-appropriate defaults with parental controls
  - id: CHILD-POS-004
