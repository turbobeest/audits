  what: |
    Examines how user safety is prioritized throughout the product
    lifecycle, assessing:
    - Safety-by-design principles in product development
    - Risk assessment processes for new features
    - User safety incident response capabilities
    - Balance of growth metrics with safety considerations
    - Safety features available to users (blocking, reporting)
    - Proactive safety monitoring and intervention
    - Crisis response and user communication
    - Safety team resourcing and authority
  why_it_matters: |
    User safety failures have severe consequences for individuals
    and organizations:
    - Platforms have been implicated in real-world harm
    - Safety incidents lead to regulatory action and legislation
    - Users lose trust when safety is deprioritized for growth
    - Lack of safety features enables abuse and harassment
    - Reactive safety approaches fail to prevent harm
    - Under-resourced safety teams cannot protect users effectively
    - Legal liability for foreseeable harm is increasing

    Prioritizing user safety protects individuals, maintains trust,
    and reduces legal and regulatory risk.
  when_to_run:
  - When launching new features with potential safety impact
  - During platform safety assessments
  - After safety incidents or near-misses
  - When scaling user base significantly

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SAFE-CRIT-001
    signal: No safety review process for new features
    evidence_indicators:
    - Features launch without safety assessment
    - No safety sign-off in release process
    - Safety concerns raised only after incidents
    explanation: |
      Without proactive safety review, harmful features launch
      and cause user harm that could have been prevented.
    remediation: Implement mandatory safety review for all features with user interaction
  - id: SAFE-CRIT-002
    signal: Safety team cannot block harmful features
    evidence_indicators:
    - Safety concerns overridden by product/growth
    - No escalation path for safety veto
    - Safety team not included in key decisions
    explanation: |
      If safety cannot prevent known harmful features from launching,
      users will be harmed and the organization faces liability.
    remediation: Establish safety authority to block or delay launches
  high:
  - id: SAFE-HIGH-001
    signal: No user blocking or reporting mechanisms
    explanation: |
      Without self-protection tools, users cannot defend themselves
      from harassment, abuse, or other harms on the platform.
    remediation: Implement comprehensive user safety controls (block, mute, report)
  - id: SAFE-HIGH-002
    signal: Safety team significantly under-resourced
    explanation: |
      Under-staffed safety teams cannot prevent or respond to
      harms at scale, leaving users unprotected.
    remediation: Resource safety team appropriately for user base size
  - id: SAFE-HIGH-003
    signal: No proactive safety monitoring
    explanation: |
      Waiting for user reports misses organized abuse and
      leaves harms unaddressed until reported.
    remediation: Implement proactive detection and monitoring for safety issues
  medium:
  - id: SAFE-MED-001
    signal: Safety metrics not tracked or reported to leadership
    remediation: Establish safety KPIs with executive visibility
  - id: SAFE-MED-002

    remediation: Update and regularly exercise safety incident response
  - id: SAFE-MED-003
    signal: Safety features inconsistent across platforms
    remediation: Ensure safety feature parity across all product surfaces
