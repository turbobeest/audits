  what: |
    Examines systems and processes for preventing and addressing
    online harassment, assessing:
    - Anti-harassment policies and definitions
    - User blocking and muting capabilities
    - Harassment reporting mechanisms
    - Report review and response processes
    - Proactive harassment detection
    - Escalation to law enforcement when appropriate
    - Victim support and resources
    - Repeat offender management
    - Coordinated harassment prevention
  why_it_matters: |
    Online harassment causes significant harm and drives users away:
    - Harassment disproportionately affects marginalized groups
    - Victims experience psychological, professional, and physical harm
    - Platforms that enable harassment face regulatory and legal action
    - Users leave platforms where they don't feel safe
    - Harassment reduces diversity and participation
    - Coordinated harassment campaigns require specialized response
    - Inadequate response normalizes abusive behavior

    Effective harassment prevention creates safer spaces and
    maintains community trust.
  when_to_run:
  - When launching community or social features
  - Following harassment incidents or complaints
  - During platform safety assessments
  - When harassment metrics increase

signals:
  critical:
  - id: HARASS-CRIT-001
    signal: No mechanism for users to report harassment
    evidence_indicators:
    - No report button or form
    - Reports go to unmonitored inbox
    - No harassment-specific reporting option
    explanation: |
      Without reporting mechanisms, users cannot seek help when
      harassed, and the platform cannot address abuse.
    remediation: Implement accessible harassment reporting with clear response process
  - id: HARASS-CRIT-002
    signal: No blocking or muting capability for users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users cannot prevent contact from others
    - Blocked users can still view content
    - No way to stop unwanted interactions
    explanation: |
      Users need self-protection tools to immediately stop
      harassment while reports are reviewed.
    remediation: Implement comprehensive blocking and muting features
  high:
  - id: HARASS-HIGH-001
    signal: Harassment reports reviewed slowly or inconsistently
    explanation: |
      Slow response leaves victims exposed to ongoing harassment
      and signals that abuse is tolerated.
    remediation: Set and enforce SLAs for harassment report review
  - id: HARASS-HIGH-002
    signal: No process for credible threat escalation
    explanation: |
      Threats of violence require law enforcement involvement;
      failure to escalate creates liability and risk.
    remediation: Implement clear process for escalating credible threats to law enforcement
  - id: HARASS-HIGH-003
    signal: Repeat harassers not tracked or managed
    explanation: |
      Without repeat offender tracking, serial harassers continue
      causing harm through new accounts or targets.
    remediation: Implement repeat offender tracking and graduated consequences
  medium:
  - id: HARASS-MED-001
    signal: Anti-harassment policy vague or hard to find
    remediation: Publish clear, specific anti-harassment policy prominently
  - id: HARASS-MED-002
    signal: No proactive harassment detection
    remediation: Implement automated detection for common harassment patterns
  - id: HARASS-MED-003
    signal: Coordinated harassment not specifically addressed
    remediation: Develop procedures for identifying and responding to coordinated campaigns
  low:
  - id: HARASS-LOW-001
