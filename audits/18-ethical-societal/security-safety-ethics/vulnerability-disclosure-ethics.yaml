  what: |
    Examines the ethics of vulnerability disclosure practices, assessing:
    - Existence and accessibility of vulnerability reporting channels
    - Safe harbor protections for security researchers
    - Response timeliness and researcher communication
    - Coordinated disclosure policy and practices
    - Bug bounty program fairness and transparency
    - Public disclosure timeline ethics
    - Researcher acknowledgment and credit
    - Legal treatment of good-faith researchers
  why_it_matters: |
    Ethical vulnerability disclosure practices protect both users and
    the security research community:
    - Without safe harbor, researchers fear legal action for helping
    - Hostile policies drive vulnerabilities to black markets
    - Slow or opaque responses leave users at risk longer
    - Fair bug bounties attract skilled researchers
    - Coordinated disclosure balances researcher freedom and user protection
    - Poor practices damage reputation in security community
    - Users depend on responsible disclosure to protect their data

    Ethical disclosure practices improve security outcomes and maintain
    trust with the security research community.

  - During security program maturity assessments
  - When reviewing bug bounty program effectiveness

signals:
  critical:
  - id: VD-CRIT-001
    signal: No mechanism for security researchers to report vulnerabilities
    evidence_indicators:
    - No security contact email or form
    - No security.txt file
    - No bug bounty or VDP program
    explanation: |
      Without a reporting channel, researchers cannot safely disclose
      vulnerabilities, leaving users exposed and driving discoveries
      to black markets or full public disclosure.
    remediation: Establish clear vulnerability reporting channel with security.txt
  - id: VD-CRIT-002
    signal: Legal threats against good-faith security researchers
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cease and desist letters to researchers
    - CFAA threats for vulnerability testing
    - No safe harbor provisions
    explanation: |
      Threatening legal action against good-faith researchers chills
      security research, damages reputation, and leaves vulnerabilities
      unreported or disclosed unsafely.
    remediation: Implement safe harbor policy protecting good-faith research
  high:
  - id: VD-HIGH-001
    signal: Vulnerability reports go unacknowledged for weeks
    explanation: |
      Slow acknowledgment leaves researchers uncertain if reports
      were received and may trigger premature disclosure.
    remediation: Acknowledge vulnerability reports within 48-72 hours
  - id: VD-HIGH-002
    signal: No coordinated disclosure timeline or process
    explanation: |
      Without agreed timelines, researchers and vendors conflict
      on disclosure, potentially harming users.
    remediation: Establish clear coordinated disclosure process with standard timelines
  - id: VD-HIGH-003
    signal: Bug bounty rewards significantly below market rates
    explanation: |
      Below-market bounties drive skilled researchers elsewhere
      and may push discoveries to vulnerability brokers.
    remediation: Benchmark and adjust bounty rewards to competitive levels
  medium:
  - id: VD-MED-001
    signal: Researchers not credited or acknowledged for discoveries
    remediation: Credit researchers in security advisories and hall of fame
  - id: VD-MED-002
    signal: Communication gaps during vulnerability remediation
    remediation: Provide regular updates to researchers during remediation
  - id: VD-MED-003
    signal: Bug bounty scope too narrow or unclear
    remediation: Clearly define in-scope systems and testing guidelines
  low:
  - id: VD-LOW-001
    signal: No public disclosure or security advisory process
  positive:
  - id: VD-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive VDP with safe harbor provisions
  - id: VD-POS-002
    signal: Active bug bounty program with competitive rewards
  - id: VD-POS-003
    signal: security.txt published and current
  - id: VD-POS-004
