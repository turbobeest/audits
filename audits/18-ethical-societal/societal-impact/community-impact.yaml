  what: |
    Examines the broader impact of technology products and operations
    on communities, assessing:
    - Local community effects (housing, traffic, infrastructure)
    - Environmental impact on surrounding areas
    - Community engagement and feedback mechanisms

    - Displacement effects (gentrification, local business impact)
    - Community safety and wellbeing considerations

    - Disaster response and community support capabilities
  why_it_matters: |
    Technology companies have significant impacts on communities beyond
    their direct users:
    - Tech hubs drive gentrification and housing cost increases
    - Data centers affect local water and energy resources
    - Platforms can fragment or strengthen community bonds
    - Corporate presence changes local business ecosystems
    - Community support during crises builds goodwill and resilience
    - Neglecting community impact creates opposition and regulatory risk
    - ESG investors increasingly evaluate community relations

    Positive community impact creates sustainable operations and
    maintains social license to operate.
  when_to_run:
  - When opening new facilities or expanding operations
  - During community relations reviews
  - When launching features affecting community dynamics
  - For ESG reporting and assessment
