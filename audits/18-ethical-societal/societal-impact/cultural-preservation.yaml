  what: |
    Examines how technology products affect cultural diversity,
    heritage preservation, and traditional knowledge, assessing:
    - Support for minority and endangered languages
    - Cultural content digitization and preservation
    - Indigenous knowledge protection and respect
    - Cultural appropriation in AI training data
    - Platform effects on cultural homogenization
    - Local cultural expression support
    - Traditional knowledge IP protection
    - Cultural heritage accessibility
  why_it_matters: |
    Technology can either preserve or erode cultural diversity:
    - Dominant language bias marginalizes minority cultures
    - AI trained on biased data perpetuates cultural stereotypes
    - Platform algorithms favor mainstream over diverse content
    - Traditional knowledge can be exploited without consent
    - Digital preservation can save endangered cultural heritage
    - Technology enables cultural exchange and education
    - Cultural diversity drives innovation and resilience
    - UNESCO and indigenous rights frameworks require protection

    Responsible technology supports cultural diversity as a human
    heritage and competitive advantage.
  when_to_run:
  - When launching in culturally diverse markets
  - When developing AI systems using cultural content
  - During indigenous community engagement
  - When digitizing cultural heritage

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CULT-CRIT-001
    signal: Traditional knowledge exploited without community consent
    evidence_indicators:
    - Indigenous knowledge in training data without permission
    - Cultural artifacts used commercially without agreement
    - Traditional practices appropriated without attribution
    explanation: |
      Exploiting traditional knowledge violates indigenous rights
      and UNDRIP principles, creating legal and reputational risk.
    remediation: Obtain free, prior, and informed consent for any traditional knowledge use
  - id: CULT-CRIT-002
    signal: AI perpetuates harmful cultural stereotypes
    evidence_indicators:
    - Stereotypical outputs for cultural queries
    - Bias against minority cultural representations
    - Offensive cultural content generation
    explanation: |
      AI systems that perpetuate cultural stereotypes cause harm
      and reinforce discrimination against cultural minorities.
    remediation: Audit and remediate cultural bias in AI training and outputs
  high:
  - id: CULT-HIGH-001
    signal: Minority and endangered languages not supported
    explanation: |
      Lack of minority language support accelerates language
      extinction and excludes speakers from digital participation.
    remediation: Expand language support to include significant minority languages
  - id: CULT-HIGH-002
    signal: Algorithm favors mainstream over diverse cultural content
    explanation: |
      Algorithmic bias toward popular content marginalizes
      minority cultural expression and accelerates homogenization.
    remediation: Ensure algorithms promote cultural diversity in recommendations
