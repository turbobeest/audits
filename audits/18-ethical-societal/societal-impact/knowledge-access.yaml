  what: |
    Examines how technology products affect access to knowledge,
    information, and educational resources, assessing:
    - Educational content accessibility
    - Academic and research resource availability
    - Paywalls and knowledge gatekeeping
    - Open access and open educational resources support
    - Information accessibility for diverse learners
    - Research data sharing and openness
    - Digital library and archive features
    - Scientific communication support
  why_it_matters: |
    Access to knowledge is foundational to human development and
    opportunity:
    - Information asymmetry perpetuates inequality
    - Paywalled research limits scientific progress
    - Educational barriers affect economic mobility
    - Open access accelerates innovation and discovery
    - Accessible knowledge supports lifelong learning
    - Information access is recognized as a human right
    - Technology can democratize or restrict knowledge access
    - SDG 4 (Quality Education) depends on accessible resources

    Technology that expands knowledge access creates broad social
    benefit and demonstrates corporate responsibility.
  when_to_run:
  - When launching educational or information products
  - When evaluating content accessibility
  - During social impact assessments
  - When considering open access policies

signals:
  critical:
  - id: KNOW-CRIT-001
    signal: Essential knowledge resources inaccessible without high payment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical health information paywalled
    - Educational essentials require expensive subscriptions
    - No academic or educational access programs
    explanation: |
      Restricting essential knowledge resources to those who can
      pay significant amounts perpetuates inequality and limits
      human development.
    remediation: Provide free or subsidized access to essential knowledge resources
  high:
  - id: KNOW-HIGH-001
    signal: Research data not shared or openly available
    explanation: |
      Keeping research data closed limits reproducibility,
      slows scientific progress, and wastes research investment.
    remediation: Implement research data sharing policies aligned with FAIR principles
  - id: KNOW-HIGH-002
    signal: Educational content not accessible to learners with disabilities
    explanation: |
      Inaccessible educational content excludes learners with
      disabilities from equal educational opportunity.
    remediation: Ensure all educational content meets accessibility standards
  - id: KNOW-HIGH-003
    signal: No programs for underserved populations
    explanation: |
      Without programs for economically disadvantaged or
      underserved learners, knowledge gaps widen.
    remediation: Develop access programs for underserved populations
  medium:
  - id: KNOW-MED-001
    signal: No support for open educational resources
    remediation: Support creation and distribution of open educational resources
  - id: KNOW-MED-002
    signal: Academic research access program limited
    remediation: Expand academic access programs for researchers and students
  - id: KNOW-MED-003
    signal: Content preservation and archiving inadequate
    remediation: Implement long-term preservation for knowledge resources
