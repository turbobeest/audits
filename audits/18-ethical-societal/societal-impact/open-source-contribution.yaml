  what: |
    Examines organizational engagement with the open source ecosystem,
    assessing:
    - Open source projects created and maintained
    - Contributions to external open source projects
    - Open source program office (OSPO) maturity
    - Responsible disclosure of dependencies
    - Support for open source maintainers
    - Open source licensing compliance
    - Engagement with open source communities
    - Open standards participation
  why_it_matters: |
    Open source is foundational to modern technology, and organizational
    engagement matters:
    - Most software depends on open source; contribution is reciprocity
    - Open source contributions attract and retain engineering talent
    - OSS engagement demonstrates technical leadership
    - Abandoned dependencies create security and sustainability risks
    - Supporting maintainers ensures ecosystem health
    - Open standards prevent vendor lock-in for users
    - ESG and corporate responsibility frameworks include open source
    - Compliance requires understanding open source in the stack

    Healthy open source engagement benefits the organization and
    the broader technology ecosystem.
  when_to_run:
  - During OSPO maturity assessments
  - When evaluating developer relations strategy
  - For ESG and sustainability reporting
  - When auditing open source compliance

signals:
  critical:
  - id: OSS-CRIT-001
    signal: License compliance violations in shipped product
    evidence_indicators:
    - GPL code in proprietary product without compliance
    - License obligations not met
    - No license scanning in place
    explanation: |
      License violations create legal liability and can require
      code release or product recall.
    remediation: Implement license scanning and ensure compliance with all OSS licenses
  high:
  - id: OSS-HIGH-001
    signal: Critical dependencies on unmaintained projects
    explanation: |
      Relying on abandoned open source creates security and
      sustainability risks that affect product stability.
    remediation: Identify unmaintained dependencies and contribute or replace
  - id: OSS-HIGH-002
    signal: Heavy open source use with zero contribution
    explanation: |
      Organizations that consume significant open source without
      contributing fail to sustain the ecosystem they depend on.
    remediation: Establish contribution program for key dependencies
  medium:
  - id: OSS-MED-001
    signal: No open source policy or OSPO
    remediation: Establish open source policy and consider OSPO
  - id: OSS-MED-002
    signal: Contributions not encouraged or enabled
    remediation: Create contribution guidelines and allocate time for OSS work
  - id: OSS-MED-003
    signal: No maintainer support for critical dependencies
    remediation: Support maintainers of critical dependencies financially or with contributions
