  what: |
    Examines the impact of technology and organizational practices on
    employment and worker welfare, assessing:
    - Automation impact on job displacement
    - Gig economy and contractor labor practices
    - Worker monitoring and algorithmic management
    - Reskilling and transition support programs
    - Supply chain labor conditions
    - Content moderator welfare
    - Remote work and work-life balance policies
    - Employment diversity and equity
  why_it_matters: |
    Technology companies have significant influence on employment patterns
    and worker welfare:
    - Automation can displace workers without adequate transition support
    - Gig economy classification affects worker benefits and protections
    - Algorithmic management can create oppressive working conditions
    - Content moderation work causes psychological harm without support
    - Supply chain labor abuses reflect on companies using those suppliers
    - Employment practices set industry standards affecting millions
    - Investor and consumer pressure on labor practices is increasing

    Responsible employment practices protect workers and build sustainable
    business models.
  when_to_run:
  - When introducing automation affecting jobs
  - During supply chain audits
  - When evaluating gig or contractor models
  - During ESG reporting preparation
