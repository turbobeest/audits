    - Political speech and content policies
    - Civic data access and protection

  why_it_matters: |
    Technology platforms have become critical infrastructure for
    democratic participation:
    - Social media is a primary source of political information
    - Platforms can be weaponized for election interference
    - Political ad targeting can manipulate or suppress voters
    - Misinformation undermines informed democratic participation
    - Government pressure on platforms can threaten free expression
    - Civic data misuse can compromise democratic processes
    - Algorithmic filter bubbles can polarize political discourse

    Responsible platforms protect democratic processes while
    enabling civic participation.
  when_to_run:
  - Before election periods
  - When political advertising policies change
  - During platform integrity assessments
  - When expanding to new democratic markets
