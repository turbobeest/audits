description:
  what: |
    Evaluates notification systems for ethical use of user attention.
    Assesses notification frequency, timing, content, urgency signals,
    and user control mechanisms. Examines whether notifications serve user
    needs or primarily drive engagement metrics. Reviews opt-in/opt-out
    mechanisms, bundling, and quiet hours respect.
  why_it_matters: |
    Notifications are powerful tools that can either help users or manipulate
    them. Excessive or manipulative notifications fragment attention, increase
    stress, and train users to ignore important communications. Poor notification
    practices damage brand perception and lead to app deletion. Respectful
    notification design builds trust and sustainable engagement.
  when_to_run:
  - When designing notification systems
  - When notification complaints increase
  - During engagement strategy reviews
  - Before launching new notification types

signals:
  critical:
  - id: NOTIF-CRIT-001
    signal: No opt-out mechanism for non-essential notifications
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot disable marketing notifications
    - No granular notification controls
    - Bundled all-or-nothing notification settings
    explanation: |
      Users must be able to control non-essential notifications. Forcing
      unwanted notifications violates user autonomy and may violate
      regulations (e.g., CAN-SPAM for email, TCPA for SMS).
    remediation: Implement granular notification preferences with opt-out
  high:
  - id: NOTIF-HIGH-001
    signal: False urgency in notification content
    evidence_pattern: (urgent|hurry|last.?chance|miss).*notification
    explanation: Using urgent language for non-urgent matters erodes trust
    remediation: Reserve urgency signals for genuinely time-sensitive content
  - id: NOTIF-HIGH-002
    signal: No quiet hours or do-not-disturb respect
    explanation: Notifications at inappropriate times disrespect user attention
    remediation: Implement quiet hours and respect system DND settings
  medium:
  - id: NOTIF-MED-001
    signal: High notification frequency without bundling
    remediation: Implement notification bundling and digests
  - id: NOTIF-MED-002
    signal: Notification opt-in not clear and affirmative
    remediation: Require explicit opt-in for non-essential notifications
  low:
  - id: NOTIF-LOW-001
    signal: Notification value not communicated at permission request
    remediation: Explain notification value proposition before requesting permission
  positive:
  - id: NOTIF-POS-001
    signal: Granular notification categories with individual controls
  - id: NOTIF-POS-002
    signal: Smart notification timing based on user behavior
  - id: NOTIF-POS-003
    signal: Notification digest option to reduce interruptions
