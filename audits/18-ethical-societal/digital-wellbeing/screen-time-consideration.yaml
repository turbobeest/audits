  what: |
    Evaluates whether product design respects user time as a finite resource.
    Assesses features for time awareness including usage dashboards, session
    limits, break reminders, and intentional friction. Reviews whether success
    metrics prioritize time-on-site or value delivered. Examines efficiency
    of user journeys and presence of unnecessary time sinks.
  why_it_matters: |
    User attention is finite and valuable. Products that maximize time spent
    rather than value delivered exploit users. Excessive screen time is linked
    to mental health issues, especially in youth. Regulators increasingly
    require time awareness features, particularly for minors. Designing for
    time respect builds sustainable user relationships and differentiates
    ethical products.
  when_to_run:
  - When designing engagement features
  - During product ethics reviews
  - When launching products for vulnerable populations
  - Following concerns about excessive usage

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TIME-CRIT-001
    signal: Design explicitly optimizes for time-on-site without user value consideration
    evidence_indicators:
    - Primary KPI is session duration
    - No consideration of value delivered
    - Features designed to extend time without purpose
    explanation: |
      Optimizing purely for time spent treats users as resources to extract
      rather than people to serve. This exploitative approach harms users
      and creates unsustainable engagement.
    remediation: Redefine success metrics to include value delivered, not just time spent
  high:
  - id: TIME-HIGH-001
    signal: No usage visibility for users
    explanation: Users cannot make informed choices without knowing their usage
    remediation: Provide usage dashboard showing time spent and patterns
  - id: TIME-HIGH-002
    signal: No time limit or break features for high-engagement products
    explanation: High-engagement products need safeguards against excessive use
    remediation: Implement optional time limits and break reminders
  medium:
  - id: TIME-MED-001
    signal: Unnecessary friction in completing tasks
    remediation: Optimize user journeys for efficiency
  - id: TIME-MED-002
    signal: No integration with system time management (Screen Time, Digital Wellbeing)
    remediation: Integrate with OS-level time management features
  low:
  - id: TIME-LOW-001
    signal: No completion signals for natural stopping points
    remediation: Provide clear signals when user has accomplished their goal
  positive:
  - id: TIME-POS-001

  - id: TIME-POS-002
    signal: Optional daily usage limits with notifications
  - id: TIME-POS-003
