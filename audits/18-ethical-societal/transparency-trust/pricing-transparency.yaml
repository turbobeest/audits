  what: |
    Examines the transparency and clarity of pricing communications,
    assessing:
    - Visibility of all costs before purchase
    - Clarity of recurring billing terms
    - Disclosure of fees and surcharges
    - Free trial terms and conversion to paid
    - Cancellation and refund policies
    - Price increase notification practices
    - Comparison to advertised prices
    - Currency and regional pricing clarity
  why_it_matters: |
    Opaque pricing practices harm consumers and create legal/reputational
    risks for businesses:
    - Hidden fees are a leading cause of consumer complaints
    - FTC and regulators actively target "drip pricing" and dark patterns
    - Unexpected charges lead to chargebacks and customer loss
    - Trust erosion spreads through reviews and social media
    - Class action lawsuits target misleading price advertising
    - Consumer protection laws require clear price disclosure

    Transparent pricing builds customer trust, reduces support burden,
    and ensures regulatory compliance.
  when_to_run:
  - When launching new pricing or products
  - Before marketing campaigns featuring pricing
  - During consumer protection compliance reviews
  - When customer complaints mention unexpected charges

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PRICE-CRIT-001
    signal: Mandatory fees not disclosed until checkout
    evidence_indicators:
    - Service fees added at cart/checkout
    - Processing fees appear only during payment
    - Required add-ons not shown on pricing page
    explanation: |
      Adding mandatory fees only at checkout is a form of drip pricing
      that violates FTC guidelines and constitutes deceptive advertising.
    remediation: Display all mandatory fees upfront on pricing pages
  - id: PRICE-CRIT-002
    signal: Free trial converts to paid without clear disclosure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Trial end date not prominently shown
    - Conversion terms buried in fine print
    - No reminder before first charge
    explanation: |
      Unclear trial-to-paid conversion violates ROSCA and creates
      significant chargeback and trust issues.

  - id: PRICE-HIGH-001
    signal: Advertised price differs from checkout price

    signal: Price increases applied without advance notice
