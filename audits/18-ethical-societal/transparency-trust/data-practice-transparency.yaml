  what: |
    Examines how clearly and completely data practices are communicated
    to users, assessing:
    - Privacy policy clarity and completeness
    - Just-in-time data collection notices
    - Third-party data sharing disclosures
    - Data retention period communication
    - User control and preference options
    - Cookie and tracking disclosures
    - Data breach notification practices
    - Data subject rights communication
  why_it_matters: |
    Users have a right to understand how their data is used, and
    regulations increasingly mandate transparent disclosure:
    - GDPR requires clear, plain language privacy notices
    - CCPA mandates disclosure of data sales and sharing
    - Hidden data practices erode trust when discovered
    - Data breaches are more damaging without prior transparency
    - Users cannot exercise rights they don't know they have
    - Regulatory fines for inadequate disclosure can be substantial

    Transparent data practices build user trust and demonstrate
    ethical data stewardship.

  - When updating privacy policies
  - When adding new data collection
  - During privacy compliance reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DATA-CRIT-001
    signal: Data collection not disclosed in privacy policy
    evidence_indicators:
    - Tracking scripts without privacy policy mention
    - Third-party data sharing undocumented
    - Sensitive data collection not disclosed
    explanation: |
      Collecting data without disclosure violates GDPR transparency
      requirements, CCPA notice requirements, and FTC expectations.
    remediation: Document all data collection in privacy policy; add just-in-time notices
  - id: DATA-CRIT-002
    signal: No consent mechanism for tracking/cookies
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cookies set before consent
    - No cookie banner or consent interface
    - No opt-out mechanism available
    explanation: |
      Setting tracking cookies without consent violates ePrivacy
      Directive and GDPR requirements in EU, and may violate CCPA
      opt-out requirements.
    remediation: Implement compliant consent management with opt-out capability
  high:
  - id: DATA-HIGH-001
    signal: Third-party data sharing not specifically disclosed
    explanation: |
      Users have a right to know who receives their data; generic
      disclosures don't meet regulatory requirements.
    remediation: List specific third parties or categories receiving user data
  - id: DATA-HIGH-002
    signal: Data retention periods not communicated
    explanation: |
      GDPR requires disclosure of retention periods; users cannot
      exercise deletion rights without understanding retention.
    remediation: Clearly communicate data retention periods by data type
  - id: DATA-HIGH-003
    signal: User rights not explained or accessible
    explanation: |
      Users cannot exercise rights (access, deletion, portability)
      if they don't know they exist or how to invoke them.
    remediation: Clearly explain user rights and provide accessible exercise mechanisms
  medium:
  - id: DATA-MED-001
    signal: Privacy policy uses excessive legal jargon
    remediation: Rewrite policy in plain language; provide layered disclosure
  - id: DATA-MED-002
    signal: No just-in-time notices for sensitive collection
    remediation: Add contextual notices when collecting sensitive data
  - id: DATA-MED-003
    signal: Data preference settings difficult to find
    remediation: Provide clear, accessible privacy preference center
  low:
