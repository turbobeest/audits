  what: |
    Assesses the clarity and accessibility of Terms of Service (ToS),
    privacy policies, and related legal agreements, examining:
    - Reading level and plain language usage
    - Document length and structure
    - Summary or highlight availability
    - Key terms prominence (data use, liability, termination)
    - Version history and change notification practices
    - Accessibility of documents (format, findability)
    - Translations available for supported languages
    - Clarity of user rights and recourse options
  why_it_matters: |
    Complex, lengthy legal documents that users cannot understand
    create significant ethical and practical problems:
    - Users cannot give truly informed consent
    - Hidden terms can lead to user harm and erode trust
    - Regulators increasingly require plain language disclosures
    - Class action lawsuits target unclear or misleading terms
    - User trust decreases when agreements feel like traps
    - GDPR and other regulations require accessible privacy notices

    Clear, understandable terms build user trust and demonstrate
    commitment to transparent business practices.
  when_to_run:
  - When drafting or updating Terms of Service
  - Before launching in new jurisdictions
  - During compliance and legal reviews
  - When user feedback indicates confusion about terms

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TOS-CRIT-001
    signal: Terms require college graduate reading level (17+ grade)
    evidence_indicators:
    - Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level > 16
    - Dense legal jargon throughout
    - Sentences averaging 30+ words
    explanation: |
      Documents requiring advanced education to understand exclude
      most users from informed consent and may violate plain language
      requirements in regulations like GDPR.
    remediation: Rewrite using plain language principles; target 8th grade reading level
  - id: TOS-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical user rights buried or obscured
    evidence_indicators:
    - Data deletion rights in middle of unrelated section
    - Arbitration clauses not highlighted
    - Auto-renewal terms hidden
    explanation: |
      Burying important terms that affect user rights or finances
      may constitute unfair business practices and erodes trust.
    remediation: Highlight critical terms prominently; provide summary sections
  high:
  - id: TOS-HIGH-001
    signal: Terms of Service exceed 5000 words without summary
    explanation: |
      Extremely long documents without summaries are effectively
      unreadable, making informed consent impossible.
    remediation: Provide plain language summary highlighting key points
  - id: TOS-HIGH-002
    signal: No version history or change notification process
    explanation: |
      Users cannot track what has changed in agreements, undermining
      ability to understand current obligations.
    remediation: Maintain version history and notify users of material changes
