description:
  what: |
    Evaluates software design decisions that impact electronic waste including
    device compatibility, performance requirements, update policies, and
    backward compatibility. Assesses whether software contributes to premature
    device obsolescence or supports device longevity. Reviews support for
    older devices, lite versions, and progressive enhancement.
  why_it_matters: |
    E-waste is one of the fastest growing waste streams globally. Software
    bloat and aggressive update requirements force hardware replacement
    prematurely. Supporting older devices extends their useful life and
    reduces e-waste. EU regulations increasingly mandate repairability and
    longevity. Designing for device longevity also expands addressable market
    to users with older devices.
  when_to_run:
  - When setting minimum device requirements
  - During performance budget planning
  - When deprecating platform support
  - During sustainability assessments

signals:
  critical:
  - id: EWAS-CRIT-001
    signal: Aggressive minimum requirements excluding functional devices
    evidence_indicators:
    - Min requirements higher than necessary for functionality
    - Recent devices unsupported without technical justification
    explanation: |
      Setting minimum requirements higher than technically necessary
      contributes to premature device obsolescence and e-waste. Every
      excluded device generation represents potential e-waste.
    remediation: Lower minimum requirements to what's technically necessary
  high:
  - id: EWAS-HIGH-001
    signal: No lite or low-resource version available
    explanation: Users with older/lower-spec devices have no option
    remediation: Consider lite version for resource-constrained devices
  - id: EWAS-HIGH-002
    signal: Support dropped for devices still in common use
    explanation: Dropping support forces users to upgrade hardware
    remediation: Maintain support for devices with significant user base
  medium:
  - id: EWAS-MED-001
    signal: No performance budgets constraining resource usage
    remediation: Establish performance budgets to prevent bloat
  - id: EWAS-MED-002
    signal: Heavy assets without progressive enhancement
    remediation: Implement progressive enhancement for varied capabilities
  low:
  - id: EWAS-LOW-001
    signal: Device longevity not in product planning
    remediation: Include device longevity in product roadmap discussions
  positive:
  - id: EWAS-POS-001
    signal: Lite version available for older devices
