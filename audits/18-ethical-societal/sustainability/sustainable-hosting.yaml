  what: |
    Evaluates hosting infrastructure for environmental sustainability
    including cloud provider renewable energy commitments, region-specific
    energy mix, data center efficiency (PUE), and provider sustainability
    practices. Assesses hosting decisions against carbon intensity data
    and available sustainable alternatives.
  why_it_matters: |
    Hosting provider and region selection significantly impact carbon footprint.
    Major cloud providers have varying renewable energy commitments and regional
    energy mixes differ substantially. Choosing sustainable hosting is one of
    the most impactful decisions for digital sustainability. Provider transparency
    and commitments also affect ability to report accurate Scope 3 emissions.
  when_to_run:
  - During infrastructure planning
  - When selecting new cloud providers
  - When evaluating region expansion
  - During annual sustainability reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: HOST-CRIT-001
    signal: Hosting provider has no renewable energy commitment
    evidence_indicators:
    - Provider not 100% renewable or committed
    - No emissions data available from provider
    explanation: |
      Providers without renewable commitments have higher carbon intensity.
      Major cloud providers have pledged carbon neutrality or 100% renewable.
      Using non-committed providers increases Scope 3 emissions.
    remediation: Migrate to provider with renewable energy commitment
  high:
  - id: HOST-HIGH-001
    signal: Resources in high-carbon intensity regions
    explanation: Region energy mix significantly impacts emissions
    remediation: Migrate workloads to low-carbon regions where feasible
  - id: HOST-HIGH-002
    signal: No consideration of sustainability in hosting decisions
    explanation: Sustainability should be a factor in infrastructure choices
    remediation: Include carbon intensity in region selection criteria
  medium:
  - id: HOST-MED-001
    signal: Provider sustainability data not being tracked
    remediation: Enable provider carbon dashboards and tracking
  - id: HOST-MED-002
    signal: Legacy hosting not on modern efficient infrastructure
    remediation: Plan migration to modern, efficient infrastructure
  low:
  - id: HOST-LOW-001
    signal: Provider PUE not documented
    remediation: Document provider efficiency metrics
  positive:
