description:
  what: |
    Evaluates renewable energy usage across infrastructure including cloud
    providers' renewable energy procurement, office energy sourcing, and
    opportunities for carbon-aware computing. Assesses alignment with
    science-based targets and renewable energy certificates (RECs).
  why_it_matters: |
    Renewable energy directly reduces Scope 2 emissions. Cloud providers
    increasingly offer carbon-free energy options, and choosing appropriately
    powered regions can significantly reduce carbon footprint. Stakeholders
    expect transparency about energy sourcing. Science-based targets typically
    require increasing renewable energy percentage over time.
  when_to_run:
  - During infrastructure planning
  - When preparing sustainability reports
  - During science-based target setting
  - When evaluating new providers

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RENEW-CRIT-001
    signal: Major infrastructure in non-renewable regions without mitigation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Significant compute in high-carbon regions
    - No RECs or carbon offsets
    - No migration plan
    explanation: |
      Infrastructure powered by fossil fuels has significantly higher
      emissions. Without mitigation, this represents substantial
      unaddressed carbon footprint.
    remediation: Migrate to renewable-powered regions or procure RECs
  high:
  - id: RENEW-HIGH-001
    signal: No visibility into provider energy sourcing
    explanation: Cannot report Scope 2/3 emissions without energy data
    remediation: Enable cloud carbon dashboards; request provider data
  - id: RENEW-HIGH-002
    signal: Carbon-aware computing not implemented
    explanation: Workloads could be shifted to times/places with cleaner energy
    remediation: Implement carbon-aware scheduling for flexible workloads
  medium:
  - id: RENEW-MED-001
    signal: No renewable energy target
    remediation: Set target for renewable energy percentage
  - id: RENEW-MED-002
    signal: RECs not matched to consumption
    remediation: Ensure REC procurement matches energy consumption
  low:
  - id: RENEW-LOW-001
    signal: Renewable energy not in vendor criteria
    remediation: Include renewable energy in vendor selection
