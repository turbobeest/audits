description:
  what: |
    Evaluates and validates technology choices for migration target platforms
    including frameworks, databases, cloud services, and tools. This audit
    assesses whether selected technologies meet functional requirements,
    non-functional requirements, team capabilities, and long-term viability,
    helping avoid costly re-migrations.

  why_it_matters: |
    Technology selection decisions during migration have long-lasting consequences.
    Choosing technologies that don't fit requirements or team capabilities leads
    to project failure or immediate re-migration. Thorough technology evaluation
    ensures the migration target is appropriate and sustainable.

  when_to_run:
    - "During migration target design"
    - "Before committing to technology stack"
    - "When evaluating multiple options"
    - "As part of architecture review"

        - "Performance requirements unachievable"
        - "Compliance requirements not supported"
        - "Integration requirements impossible"
      explanation: |
        Technology that fundamentally cannot meet requirements will cause
        project failure or require mid-migration technology change.
      remediation: "Re-evaluate technology selection with requirements alignment"

    - id: "MTS-CRIT-002"
      signal: "Technology approaching end-of-life or vendor instability"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "EOL announced within 3 years"
        - "Vendor acquisition or financial trouble"
        - "Community abandonment"
      explanation: |
        Migrating to dying technology creates immediate re-migration need.
      remediation: "Select technology with strong long-term viability"
