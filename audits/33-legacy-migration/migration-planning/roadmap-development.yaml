description:
  what: |
    Creates or validates a comprehensive migration roadmap including timelines,
    resource requirements, milestones, dependencies, and decision gates. This
    audit ensures the roadmap is realistic, properly sequenced, accounts for all
    constraints, and aligns with business objectives and technical capabilities.
  why_it_matters: |
    Migration roadmaps often fail due to unrealistic timelines, hidden dependencies,
    or inadequate resource planning. A validated roadmap reduces the risk of
    delays, cost overruns, and failed migrations by ensuring all factors are
    considered upfront and realistic expectations are set.
  when_to_run:
  - During migration planning initiation
  - When roadmap requires updates
  - Before committing budget and resources
  - During program reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RMD-CRIT-001
    signal: Timeline physically impossible given constraints
    evidence_indicators:
    - Work estimates exceed available time
    - Resource capacity insufficient
    - Dependencies cannot be parallelized
    explanation: |
      An impossible timeline sets the project up for failure from the start
      and damages credibility when inevitably missed.
    remediation: Revise timeline with realistic estimates and constraints
  - id: RMD-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical dependencies not identified in roadmap
    evidence_indicators:
    - External systems not accounted for
    - Team availability assumptions invalid
    - Regulatory deadlines not considered
    explanation: |
      Unknown dependencies cause delays and scope changes when discovered
      during execution.
    remediation: Conduct comprehensive dependency analysis
  high:
  - id: RMD-HIGH-001
    signal: No contingency buffer in timeline
    remediation: Add appropriate contingency based on risk
  - id: RMD-HIGH-002
    signal: Resource allocation conflicts not resolved
    remediation: Resolve resource conflicts before committing
  - id: RMD-HIGH-003
    signal: Success criteria not measurable
    remediation: Define measurable success criteria for milestones
  medium:
  - id: RMD-MED-001
    signal: Roadmap not aligned with business cycles
    remediation: Adjust timing for business constraints
  - id: RMD-MED-002
    signal: Communication cadence not defined
    remediation: Establish regular status reporting
  low:
  - id: RMD-LOW-001
    signal: Minor formatting issues in roadmap
    remediation: Standardize roadmap presentation
  - id: RMD-LOW-002
    signal: Historical lessons not incorporated
    remediation: Review and apply lessons from past migrations
  positive:
  - id: RMD-POS-001
    signal: Realistic timeline with appropriate contingency
  - id: RMD-POS-002
    signal: Clear milestones with measurable success criteria
