description:
  what: |
    Develops and validates an incremental migration strategy by identifying
    migration phases, sequencing component transitions, defining success criteria
    for each phase, and establishing decision gates. This audit creates a
    structured approach to migrating systems piece by piece while maintaining
    business continuity.
  why_it_matters: |
    Big-bang migrations carry enormous risk of extended downtime and failure.
    Incremental migration reduces risk by delivering value in smaller batches
    and providing opportunities to learn and adjust. A well-planned incremental
    strategy ensures each phase builds toward the final state safely.
  when_to_run:
  - After deciding on incremental approach
  - During migration planning phase
  - When refining migration roadmap
  - Before committing migration resources

signals:
  critical:
  - id: IMS-CRIT-001
    signal: Proposed phases create circular dependencies
    evidence_indicators:
    - Phase A requires Phase B complete
    - Phase B requires Phase A complete
    - No valid ordering possible
    explanation: |
      Circular dependencies in migration phases make incremental migration
      impossible without significant rework of the strategy.
    remediation: Redesign phases to break dependency cycles
  - id: IMS-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical functionality lacks migration path
    evidence_indicators:
    - Core business function not addressed in phases
    - Gap between current and target state undefined
    explanation: |
      Missing migration paths for critical functions will either halt
      migration or require emergency big-bang transitions.
    remediation: Define explicit migration path for all critical functions
  high:
  - id: IMS-HIGH-001
    signal: Phase durations exceed team capacity
