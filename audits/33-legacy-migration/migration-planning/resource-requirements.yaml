description:
  what: |
    Assesses and validates resource requirements for migration including team
    composition, skill requirements, tool and infrastructure needs, and budget
    allocation. This audit ensures migration plans have adequate resources
    committed and identifies gaps that could cause project failure.
  why_it_matters: |
    Under-resourced migrations fail. Teams stretched across migration and BAU work
    cannot deliver either effectively. Understanding true resource requirements
    enables realistic planning and prevents the common failure mode of attempting
    migration without adequate investment.
  when_to_run:
  - During migration planning
  - Before resource commitment
  - When scope changes significantly
  - During program reviews

  interview_questions:
  - role: Program Manager
    questions:
    - What resources are allocated to the migration?
    - Are migration resources dedicated or shared with BAU?
    - What happens if resource needs exceed allocation?
  - role: Engineering Manager
    questions:
    - What skill gaps exist for the migration?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MRR-CRIT-001
    signal: Resource allocation less than 50% of estimated need
    evidence_indicators:
    - Migration team severely undersized
    - Critical skills missing from team
    - No budget for necessary tools
    explanation: |
      Severely under-resourced migrations are destined to fail or drag on
      indefinitely, often costing more than proper resourcing would have.
    remediation: Increase resource allocation or reduce scope
  - id: MRR-CRIT-002
    signal: No dedicated resources for migration
    evidence_indicators:
    - All team members split with BAU work
    - Migration treated as side project
    - No clear ownership or accountability
    explanation: |
      Without dedicated focus, migrations cannot maintain momentum and
      consistently lose priority to operational concerns.
    remediation: Establish dedicated migration team
  high:
  - id: MRR-HIGH-001
    signal: Critical skills gap with no mitigation
    remediation: Plan training, hiring, or contractor engagement
  - id: MRR-HIGH-002
    signal: Resource conflicts with other projects
    remediation: Resolve conflicts through prioritization
  - id: MRR-HIGH-003
    signal: Budget insufficient for estimated needs
    remediation: Increase budget or adjust scope
  medium:
  - id: MRR-MED-001
    signal: Contingency resources not identified
    remediation: Identify backup resources for critical roles
  - id: MRR-MED-002
    signal: Tool and infrastructure costs not budgeted
    remediation: Complete infrastructure cost assessment
  low:
  - id: MRR-LOW-001
    signal: Minor resource timing misalignments
    remediation: Adjust timeline or resource scheduling
  - id: MRR-LOW-002
    signal: Training schedule not finalized
    remediation: Complete training schedule
  positive:
  - id: MRR-POS-001
    signal: Dedicated team with appropriate skills
  - id: MRR-POS-002
    signal: Budget includes appropriate contingency
