description:
  what: |
    Identifies, assesses, and plans mitigation for risks specific to migration
    projects including technical risks, business continuity risks, organizational
    risks, and external dependencies. This audit creates a comprehensive risk
    register with likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies.
  why_it_matters: |
    Migrations carry inherent risks that differ from typical software projects.
    Data loss, extended downtime, integration failures, and user disruption are
    common migration failures. Proactive risk identification and mitigation
    planning significantly improves migration success rates.
  when_to_run:
  - During migration planning
  - Before major migration phases
  - When significant changes occur
  - As part of program governance

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MRA-CRIT-001
    signal: Single point of failure with no mitigation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical dependency on single system or person
    - No backup plan for key components
    - Failure would halt entire migration
    explanation: |
      Unmitigated single points of failure represent unacceptable risk
      that could cause complete migration failure.
    remediation: Develop redundancy or backup plans immediately
  - id: MRA-CRIT-002
    signal: Data loss risk without mitigation
    evidence_indicators:
    - No verified backup before migration
    - Data transformation without validation
    - Irreversible data changes planned
    explanation: |
      Data loss during migration can be catastrophic and often irreversible.
    remediation: Implement comprehensive backup and validation procedures
  high:
  - id: MRA-HIGH-001
    signal: Business continuity risk inadequately addressed
    remediation: Develop detailed business continuity procedures
  - id: MRA-HIGH-002
    signal: Integration risks not fully assessed
    remediation: Complete integration risk analysis
  - id: MRA-HIGH-003
    signal: No contingency for timeline overrun
    remediation: Develop schedule contingency plans
  medium:
  - id: MRA-MED-001
    signal: Training risks not addressed
    remediation: Include training in risk mitigation
  - id: MRA-MED-002
    signal: Change management risks underestimated
    remediation: Strengthen change management approach
  low:
  - id: MRA-LOW-001
    signal: Minor operational risks
    remediation: Monitor and address as needed
  - id: MRA-LOW-002
    signal: Risk register format inconsistent
    remediation: Standardize risk documentation
  positive:
  - id: MRA-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive risk register with mitigations
  - id: MRA-POS-002
    signal: Regular risk review cadence established
