description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the business importance of legacy systems by analyzing their role
    in business processes, revenue impact, regulatory compliance requirements,
    and operational dependencies. This audit classifies systems by criticality
    tier to inform migration priority, risk tolerance, and investment decisions.
  why_it_matters: |
    Not all legacy systems deserve equal migration investment. Understanding
    business criticality ensures resources are allocated to the most important
    systems first. Critical systems require more careful migration planning
    and may justify higher investment in modernization approaches.
  when_to_run:
  - During portfolio rationalization
  - When prioritizing migration efforts
  - As part of business continuity planning
  - Before budget allocation decisions

signals:
  critical:
  - id: BCA-CRIT-001
    signal: Tier-1 critical system on unsupported platform
    evidence_indicators:
    - Revenue-generating system on EOL platform
    - Regulatory-required system without support
    - Core business process dependent on legacy technology
    explanation: |
      Business-critical systems on unsupported platforms represent unacceptable
      risk. Failure would cause significant business disruption.
    remediation: Prioritize migration as highest priority initiative
  - id: BCA-CRIT-002
    signal: No business continuity plan for critical legacy system
    evidence_indicators:
    - No disaster recovery capability
    - Single point of failure with no mitigation
    - Extended downtime would halt business operations
    explanation: |
      Critical systems without continuity plans expose the business to
      catastrophic failure scenarios.
    remediation: Implement immediate disaster recovery and continuity measures
  high:
  - id: BCA-HIGH-001
    signal: Critical system approaching technology end-of-life
    remediation: Plan migration before support ends
  - id: BCA-HIGH-002
    signal: Business criticality not formally classified
    remediation: Conduct formal criticality classification
  - id: BCA-HIGH-003
    signal: Recovery time objective cannot be met with current system
    remediation: Implement measures to meet RTO requirements
  medium:
  - id: BCA-MED-001
    signal: Tier-2 system with moderate business impact
    remediation: Include in standard migration planning
  - id: BCA-MED-002
    signal: Business ownership unclear for legacy system
    remediation: Assign business owner and document responsibilities
  low:
  - id: BCA-LOW-001
    signal: Tier-3 system with limited business impact
    remediation: Evaluate for decommission or low-priority migration
  - id: BCA-LOW-002
    signal: System usage declining over time
    remediation: Consider sunsetting or consolidation
  positive:
  - id: BCA-POS-001
    signal: All systems classified by business criticality
  - id: BCA-POS-002
    signal: Critical systems have appropriate investment and support
