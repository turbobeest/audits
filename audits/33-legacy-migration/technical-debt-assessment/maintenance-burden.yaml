description:
  what: |
    Measures the ongoing maintenance burden of systems through analysis of support
    tickets, bug fix frequency, time spent on unplanned work, developer context
    switching, and operational overhead. This audit quantifies how much effort is
    consumed by maintaining existing systems versus building new capabilities,
    identifying systems that consume disproportionate maintenance resources.
  why_it_matters: |
    High maintenance burden reduces team velocity and developer satisfaction while
    increasing costs. Systems consuming excessive maintenance effort may be candidates
    for replacement or major refactoring. Understanding maintenance burden enables
    informed decisions about where to invest in modernization or deprecation.
  when_to_run:
  - During annual planning cycles
  - When teams report feeling overwhelmed
  - Before making build-vs-buy decisions
  - When evaluating legacy system retirement

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MBA-CRIT-001
    signal: Maintenance consumes over 60% of development capacity
    evidence_indicators:
    - Less than 40% of sprint capacity for new features
    - Constant firefighting mode
    - Feature velocity declining quarter over quarter
    explanation: |
      When maintenance dominates development capacity, organizations lose
      competitive advantage and team morale suffers. This level indicates
      systemic issues requiring immediate intervention.
    remediation: Implement dedicated maintenance team or major system replacement
  - id: MBA-CRIT-002
    signal: Single system consuming 30%+ of maintenance budget
    evidence_indicators:
    - One system generating majority of support tickets
    - Frequent emergency deployments for single system
    explanation: |
      A single system consuming disproportionate maintenance resources
      indicates fundamental architectural or quality issues.
    remediation: Evaluate replacement, major refactoring, or decommission
  high:
  - id: MBA-HIGH-001
    signal: Maintenance burden increasing quarter over quarter
    remediation: Allocate dedicated debt reduction resources
  - id: MBA-HIGH-002
    signal: Mean time to repair (MTTR) exceeding SLA thresholds
    remediation: Improve observability and incident response processes
  - id: MBA-HIGH-003
    signal: Recurring bugs accounting for 25%+ of fix effort
    remediation: Address root causes rather than symptoms
  medium:
  - id: MBA-MED-001
    signal: Documentation gaps causing repeated troubleshooting
    remediation: Invest in operational documentation and runbooks
  - id: MBA-MED-002
    signal: Knowledge silos creating single points of failure
    remediation: Implement knowledge sharing and pair programming
  low:
  - id: MBA-LOW-001
    signal: Minor operational inefficiencies
    remediation: Address through continuous improvement processes
  - id: MBA-LOW-002
    signal: Outdated tooling slightly impacting efficiency
    remediation: Include tooling updates in maintenance planning
  positive:
  - id: MBA-POS-001
    signal: Maintenance burden stable or decreasing
  - id: MBA-POS-002
    signal: Proactive maintenance preventing reactive firefighting
