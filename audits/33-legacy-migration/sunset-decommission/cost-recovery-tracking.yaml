description:
  what: |
    Tracks and validates cost savings realized from system decommissions
    including infrastructure costs, license fees, maintenance contracts, and
    operational overhead. This audit ensures projected savings are achieved
    and provides visibility into the ROI of decommission initiatives.
  why_it_matters: |
    Decommission business cases depend on cost savings. Tracking actual savings
    validates the investment in decommission projects and builds confidence
    for future initiatives. Unrealized savings may indicate incomplete
    decommission or flawed projections.
  when_to_run:
  - Post-decommission (30, 60, 90 days)
  - During financial review
  - When validating business case
  - For annual portfolio review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CRT-CRIT-001
    signal: Costs increased after decommission
    evidence_indicators:
    - Total costs higher than before
    - Unexpected new costs appeared
    - Migration costs exceeded savings
    explanation: |
      If costs increased, the decommission business case was fundamentally
      flawed or execution was incomplete.
    remediation: Investigate cost increase source and remediate
  high:
  - id: CRT-HIGH-001
    signal: Savings significantly below projection
    remediation: Identify unrealized savings and remediate
  - id: CRT-HIGH-002
    signal: License costs not terminated
    remediation: Cancel remaining licenses
  - id: CRT-HIGH-003
    signal: Maintenance contracts still active
    remediation: Terminate unnecessary contracts
  medium:
  - id: CRT-MED-001
    signal: Minor variance from projection
    remediation: Document variance reasons
  - id: CRT-MED-002
    signal: Savings tracking not formalized
    remediation: Implement savings tracking process
  low:
  - id: CRT-LOW-001
    signal: Savings documentation incomplete
    remediation: Complete savings documentation
  - id: CRT-LOW-002
    signal: Attribution of savings unclear
    remediation: Clarify savings attribution
  positive:
  - id: CRT-POS-001
    signal: Savings met or exceeded projection
  - id: CRT-POS-002
    signal: Clear cost reduction demonstrated
