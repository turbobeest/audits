description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the data archival strategy for systems being decommissioned,
    ensuring data is preserved according to retention requirements, remains
    accessible when needed, and is properly secured. This audit assesses
    archival formats, storage, retrieval procedures, and compliance with
    retention policies.
  why_it_matters: |
    Data from decommissioned systems may need to be retained for legal,
    regulatory, or business reasons. Improper archival can lead to data loss,
    inaccessibility when needed, or compliance violations. Good archival
    ensures data remains usable while minimizing ongoing costs.
  when_to_run:
  - During decommission planning
  - Before data migration or destruction
  - During compliance review
  - When retention requirements change

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DAA-CRIT-001
    signal: No archival plan for required retention data
    evidence_indicators:
    - Retention requirements not addressed
    - Data destruction planned without archival
    - Legal hold data at risk
    explanation: |
      Destroying data that must be retained creates legal liability
      and compliance violations.
    remediation: Implement archival before decommission
  - id: DAA-CRIT-002
    signal: Archived data will be inaccessible
    evidence_indicators:
    - No retrieval procedures
    - Format not readable
    - Dependencies destroyed
    explanation: |
      Archives that cannot be accessed when needed are worthless and
      may violate retention intent.
    remediation: Ensure accessible archive format and procedures
  high:
  - id: DAA-HIGH-001
    signal: Archive format may become obsolete
    remediation: Use standard, long-term formats
  - id: DAA-HIGH-002
    signal: Archive security insufficient
    remediation: Implement appropriate security controls
  - id: DAA-HIGH-003
    signal: No archive verification planned
    remediation: Verify archive integrity before decommission
  medium:
  - id: DAA-MED-001
    signal: Archive retrieval process complex
    remediation: Document clear retrieval procedures
  - id: DAA-MED-002
    signal: Archive storage costs not evaluated
    remediation: Assess and plan for storage costs
  low:
  - id: DAA-LOW-001
    signal: Archive documentation incomplete
    remediation: Complete archive documentation
  - id: DAA-LOW-002
    signal: Minor metadata gaps
    remediation: Capture complete metadata
  positive:
  - id: DAA-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive archival with verified retrieval
  - id: DAA-POS-002
    signal: Archival meets all retention requirements
