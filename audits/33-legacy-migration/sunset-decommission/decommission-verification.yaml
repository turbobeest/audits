description:
  what: |
    Verifies that system decommission was completed successfully including
    confirming resources are released, data handling is complete, and no
    unexpected impacts occurred. This audit performs post-decommission
    validation to ensure the retirement was clean and complete.
  why_it_matters: |
    Incomplete decommission leaves orphaned resources, potential security
    risks, and ongoing costs. Verification confirms the decommission achieved
    its goals and identifies any remediation needed for missed items.
  when_to_run:
  - After decommission execution
  - During closeout review
  - When issues are suspected
  - As part of project closure

    questions:
    - Were there any issues during decommission?
    - Are any resources still showing?
    - Have costs decreased as expected?
  - role: Security Engineer
    questions:
    - Are there any security concerns?
    - Were credentials rotated/removed?
    - Is the network segment cleaned up?

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DVF-CRIT-001
    signal: System still accessible after decommission
    evidence_indicators:
    - Services responding
    - Data accessible
    - Users can connect
    explanation: |
      Systems that remain accessible after decommission represent
      security risks and indicate incomplete execution.
    remediation: Complete system shutdown immediately
  - id: DVF-CRIT-002
    signal: Unexpected system dependencies discovered
    evidence_indicators:
    - Errors in other systems
    - Failed integrations
    - User complaints
    explanation: |
      Unexpected dependencies indicate incomplete planning and may
      require emergency remediation.
    remediation: Investigate and address broken dependencies

    signal: Costs not decreasing as expected
    remediation: Identify remaining cost sources
  - id: DVF-HIGH-003
    signal: Security credentials not rotated
    remediation: Rotate all related credentials
