description:
  what: |
    Develops and validates comprehensive plans for decommissioning systems
    including stakeholder communication, dependency analysis, data retention
    requirements, compliance considerations, and cutover scheduling. This audit
    ensures decommission plans address all aspects of safely retiring a system.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poorly planned decommissions cause unexpected outages, data loss, and
    compliance violations. Comprehensive planning ensures all dependencies
    are addressed, required data is preserved, and stakeholders are prepared
    for the system's retirement.
  when_to_run:
  - Before decommission execution
  - After retirement decision is made
  - During decommission review
  - When dependencies are discovered

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DCP-CRIT-001
    signal: Unknown dependencies exist
    evidence_indicators:
    - Systems connect to retirement target
    - Dependencies not inventoried
    - Integration impacts unknown
    explanation: |
      Unknown dependencies will break when the system is decommissioned,
      causing unexpected outages.
    remediation: Complete dependency discovery before decommission
  - id: DCP-CRIT-002
    signal: Data retention requirements not addressed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Legal hold on data
    - Regulatory retention requirements
    - No data archival plan
    explanation: |
      Destroying data without meeting retention requirements can result
      in legal liability and compliance violations.
    remediation: Implement data archival before decommission
  high:
  - id: DCP-HIGH-001
    signal: Stakeholder communication inadequate
    remediation: Develop comprehensive communication plan
  - id: DCP-HIGH-002
    signal: No rollback plan if issues arise
    remediation: Define rollback window and procedures
  - id: DCP-HIGH-003
    signal: Compliance signoff not obtained
    remediation: Obtain required compliance approvals
  medium:
  - id: DCP-MED-001
    signal: Timeline aggressive
    remediation: Allow adequate time for all steps
  - id: DCP-MED-002
    signal: Documentation archival not planned
    remediation: Plan documentation preservation
  low:
  - id: DCP-LOW-001
    signal: Minor planning details incomplete
    remediation: Complete planning details
