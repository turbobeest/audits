description:
  what: |
    Identifies systems and applications that are candidates for retirement
    based on usage patterns, business value, maintenance costs, and technology
    currency. This audit evaluates the application portfolio to find systems
    that should be sunset rather than migrated or maintained.
  why_it_matters: |
    Not every legacy system deserves migration investment. Some systems should
    simply be retired. Identifying retirement candidates frees resources for
    higher-value initiatives and reduces the maintenance burden. Continuing
    to invest in low-value systems wastes resources and increases risk.
  when_to_run:
  - During portfolio rationalization
  - Before migration planning
  - During annual IT planning
  - When budget constraints exist

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RCI-CRIT-001
    signal: Zero-usage systems still running
    evidence_indicators:
    - No active users for 6+ months
    - No transactions processed
    - System consumes resources
    explanation: |
      Systems with no usage are pure cost with no value. They should be
      decommissioned to free resources.
    remediation: Initiate immediate decommission process
  - id: RCI-CRIT-002
    signal: Replaced systems still operational
    evidence_indicators:
    - New system already in production
    - Users migrated to replacement
    - Old system still maintained
    explanation: |
      Maintaining replaced systems doubles cost without benefit.
    remediation: Complete migration and decommission legacy
  high:
  - id: RCI-HIGH-001
    signal: Maintenance cost exceeds business value
    remediation: Evaluate retirement vs simplification
  - id: RCI-HIGH-002
    signal: System on unsupported platform
    remediation: Retire or migrate to supported platform
  - id: RCI-HIGH-003
    signal: Functionality available in other systems
    remediation: Consolidate and retire redundant system
  medium:

    signal: System approaching natural end-of-life
    remediation: Plan orderly retirement
  - id: RCI-LOW-002
    signal: Minor optimization possible before retirement
    remediation: Implement quick wins only
