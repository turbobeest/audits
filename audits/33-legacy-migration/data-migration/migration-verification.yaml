description:
  what: |
    Performs final verification of migrated data before production cutover
    including end-to-end application testing, performance validation, and
    stakeholder sign-off. This audit confirms that the migrated data supports
    all business functions and meets acceptance criteria.
  why_it_matters: |
    Final verification is the last chance to catch issues before go-live.
    Production cutover without thorough verification risks discovering problems
    when they affect real users and business operations. Verification provides
    confidence for the cutover decision.
  when_to_run:
  - Before production cutover
  - After final migration rehearsal
  - As gate for go-live decision
  - During migration acceptance

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MVF-CRIT-001
    signal: Core business function fails with migrated data
    evidence_indicators:
    - Critical application errors
    - Key reports produce wrong results
    - Essential workflows broken
    explanation: |
      Business-critical function failures mean the migration is not ready
      for production and cutover would cause business disruption.
    remediation: Fix issues and re-verify before cutover
  - id: MVF-CRIT-002
    signal: Performance degradation exceeds acceptable threshold
    evidence_indicators:
    - Response times significantly slower
    - Query performance degraded
    - System cannot handle normal load
    explanation: |
      Performance degradation affects user experience and may indicate
      optimization or indexing issues in the target environment.
    remediation: Optimize performance before cutover
  high:
  - id: MVF-HIGH-001
    signal: Secondary functions fail verification
    remediation: Fix or document workarounds before cutover
  - id: MVF-HIGH-002
    signal: Stakeholder concerns not addressed
    remediation: Resolve concerns or obtain documented acceptance
  - id: MVF-HIGH-003
    signal: Incomplete test coverage for critical paths
    remediation: Complete verification testing before cutover
  medium:
  - id: MVF-MED-001
    signal: Minor functionality differences acceptable
    remediation: Document and obtain acceptance
  - id: MVF-MED-002
    signal: Non-critical performance variations
    remediation: Plan post-migration optimization
  low:
  - id: MVF-LOW-001
    signal: Cosmetic differences noted
    remediation: Address in post-migration improvements
  - id: MVF-LOW-002
    signal: Documentation gaps for new system
    remediation: Complete documentation post-cutover
  positive:
