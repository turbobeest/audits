description:
  what: |
    Evaluates testing strategies for ensuring compatibility between migrated
    systems and their integration partners. This audit examines integration
    test coverage, partner testing coordination, and verification that all
    downstream and upstream systems continue to work correctly.
  why_it_matters: |
    Migration can break integrations with systems outside the migration scope.
    These integration failures often surface in production, causing broader
    business impact than the migration itself. Proactive integration testing
    catches these issues before cutover.
  when_to_run:
  - During migration planning
  - Before integration testing phase
  - When integration issues arise
  - Before production cutover

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ICT-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical integrations have no test coverage
    evidence_indicators:
    - Payment integrations untested
    - Partner APIs not verified
    - Data exchange not validated
    explanation: |
      Untested critical integrations risk production failures affecting
      business operations and partner relationships.
    remediation: Add integration tests before migration proceeds
  - id: ICT-CRIT-002
    signal: Partner systems unavailable for testing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot test against real partner systems
    - No partner test environments
    - Partners unresponsive to coordination
    explanation: |
      Without partner testing, integration compatibility cannot be
      verified before production.
    remediation: Implement mocks or coordinate partner testing
  high:
  - id: ICT-HIGH-001
    signal: Integration test environment not representative
    remediation: Improve environment parity
  - id: ICT-HIGH-002
    signal: Downstream impact testing incomplete
    remediation: Test all downstream consumers
  - id: ICT-HIGH-003
    signal: Error scenarios not tested
    remediation: Add integration error testing
  medium:
  - id: ICT-MED-001
    signal: Integration tests not automated
    remediation: Automate integration testing
  - id: ICT-MED-002
    signal: Partner test coordination informal
    remediation: Establish formal test coordination
  low:
  - id: ICT-LOW-001
    signal: Integration test documentation incomplete
    remediation: Document integration tests
  - id: ICT-LOW-002
    signal: Minor integration test gaps
