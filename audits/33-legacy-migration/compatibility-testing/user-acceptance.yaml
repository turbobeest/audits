description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the user acceptance testing (UAT) strategy and execution for
    migration projects, ensuring end users validate that the new system meets
    their business needs. This audit assesses UAT coverage, user participation,
    test scenarios, and defect management during acceptance testing.
  why_it_matters: |
    Technical testing alone cannot validate that a system meets user needs.
    UAT provides critical validation from the people who will use the system
    daily. Poor UAT leads to post-migration user dissatisfaction and adoption
    issues that are expensive to fix.
  when_to_run:
  - Before UAT begins
  - During UAT execution
  - Before production cutover
  - When acceptance is questioned

signals:
  critical:
  - id: UAT-CRIT-001
    signal: No UAT planned before cutover
    evidence_indicators:
    - Technical testing only
    - No user involvement
    - No acceptance criteria
    explanation: |
      Proceeding to production without user validation risks deploying
      a system that doesn't meet business needs.
    remediation: Implement UAT before cutover
  - id: UAT-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical defects found in UAT unresolved
    evidence_indicators:
    - Showstopper defects open
    - Core functionality broken
    - Users cannot complete key tasks
    explanation: |
      Critical defects in UAT indicate the system is not ready for
      production use.
    remediation: Fix critical defects before cutover
  high:
  - id: UAT-HIGH-001
    signal: Limited user participation in UAT
    remediation: Expand user involvement
  - id: UAT-HIGH-002
    signal: UAT scenarios don't cover critical paths
    remediation: Expand UAT coverage
  - id: UAT-HIGH-003
    signal: Defect resolution SLA not met
    remediation: Expedite defect resolution
  medium:
  - id: UAT-MED-001
    signal: UAT environment differs from production
    remediation: Improve environment parity
  - id: UAT-MED-002
    signal: UAT timeline compressed
    remediation: Allow adequate UAT time
  low:
  - id: UAT-LOW-001
    signal: Minor UAT documentation gaps
    remediation: Complete UAT documentation
  - id: UAT-LOW-002
    signal: UAT training could be improved
    remediation: Enhance user training
  positive:
  - id: UAT-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive UAT with user sign-off
  - id: UAT-POS-002
    signal: All critical scenarios passed
