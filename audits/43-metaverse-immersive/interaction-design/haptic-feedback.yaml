description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the implementation of haptic feedback in VR including
    vibration patterns, timing, intensity, and appropriateness for
    different interactions. Assesses whether haptics enhance immersion
    without being annoying.

  why_it_matters: |
    Haptic feedback provides crucial physical confirmation of virtual
    interactions. Without haptics, interactions feel disconnected.
    With poor haptics, users are annoyed or confused. Good haptics
    significantly enhance presence and usability.

  when_to_run:
    - "During interaction design"
    - "When haptics feel wrong"
    - "During polish phase"
    - "When users report feedback issues"

        - "Interactions have no haptics"
        - "Haptic system not implemented"
      explanation: |
        Without haptics, interactions feel disconnected and less
        immersive. This is a significant UX gap.
