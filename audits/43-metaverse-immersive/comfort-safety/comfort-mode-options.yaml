description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the availability and effectiveness of comfort mode options
    in VR applications. Assesses vignetting, snap turn, teleport locomotion,
    seated mode, and other comfort settings that allow users to customize
    their experience.

  why_it_matters: |
    Users have vastly different sensitivities to VR motion. Without comfort
    options, applications exclude sensitive users entirely. Well-designed
    comfort options allow everyone to enjoy VR at their comfort level.

  when_to_run:
    - "During settings implementation"
    - "Before release"
    - "When targeting broad audiences"
    - "During accessibility review"

      evidence_indicators:
        - "No comfort settings menu"
        - "Fixed locomotion with no alternatives"
      explanation: |
        Without comfort options, sensitive users cannot use the
        application. This excludes a significant portion of users.

      evidence_indicators:
        - "Settings have no effect"
        - "Comfort features broken"
      explanation: |
        Non-functional comfort options are worse than none as users
        expect them to help.
