description:
  what: |
    Evaluates ambient and environmental sound design for XR including
    background soundscapes, environmental audio, and the overall audio
    atmosphere that supports immersion.

  why_it_matters: |
    Ambient sound defines the feel of virtual spaces. Silence is unnatural
    and breaks immersion while poor ambient audio distracts. Well-designed
    ambient sound makes virtual environments feel alive and real.

  when_to_run:
    - "During audio design review"
    - "When environments feel empty"
    - "During immersion testing"
    - "After environment changes"

      evidence_indicators:
        - "No ambient sound at all"
        - "Dead silent spaces"
      explanation: |
        Silence is unnatural and immediately noticeable.
        Even quiet spaces have some ambient sound.
      remediation: "Add appropriate ambient soundscapes"

  high:
    - id: "AS-HIGH-001"
      signal: "Ambient loops obviously repetitive"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Clear loop point audible"
        - "Pattern repetition noticed"
      remediation: "Use longer loops or random variation"

    - id: "AS-HIGH-002"
      signal: "Ambient inconsistent with visuals"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Wrong sounds for environment"
        - "Audio-visual mismatch"
      remediation: "Match ambient to environment type"

    - id: "AS-MED-002"
