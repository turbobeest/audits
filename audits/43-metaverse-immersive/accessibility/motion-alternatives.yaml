description:
  what: |
    Evaluates alternatives to motion-based interactions for users with motor
    disabilities including alternative locomotion, input remapping, and
    options to reduce physical movement requirements.
  why_it_matters: |
    Many VR experiences require physical movement that some users cannot perform.
    Without motion alternatives, users with motor disabilities are excluded.
    Alternatives also help users with limited play space.
  when_to_run:
  - During accessibility review
  - Before launch
  - When adding motion features
  - After accessibility feedback

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MA-CRIT-001
    signal: Physical motion required with no alternative
    evidence_indicators:
    - Must physically move to progress
    - No teleport or smooth movement option
    - Required gestures have no alternative
    explanation: |
      If physical motion is required with no alternative, users with
      motor disabilities cannot complete the experience.
    remediation: Add alternative locomotion and input options
  - id: MA-CRIT-002
    signal: Quick reflexes required with no accommodation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Timed actions required
    - No timing adjustment
    explanation: |
      Quick reflex requirements exclude users with motor impairments.
      Timing options or alternatives are needed.
    remediation: Add timing adjustments or alternatives
  high:
  - id: MA-HIGH-001
    signal: No teleport locomotion option
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only smooth movement available
    - Must physically walk
    remediation: Add teleport locomotion option
  - id: MA-HIGH-002
    signal: Cannot remap controls
    evidence_indicators:
    - Fixed button mapping
    - No control customization
    remediation: Add control remapping
  medium:
  - id: MA-MED-001
    signal: No one-handed mode
    remediation: Support one-handed operation
  - id: MA-MED-002
    signal: Gesture sensitivity not adjustable
    remediation: Add gesture sensitivity options
  low:
  - id: MA-LOW-001
    signal: Motion alternatives undocumented
    remediation: Document available alternatives
  positive:
  - id: MA-POS-001
    signal: Multiple locomotion options
  - id: MA-POS-002
    signal: Full control remapping
  - id: MA-POS-003
    signal: One-handed support
