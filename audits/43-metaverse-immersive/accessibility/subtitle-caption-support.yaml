  what: |
    Evaluates subtitle and caption support for deaf and hard-of-hearing users
    in VR including dialogue captions, environmental sound captions, speaker
    identification, and caption positioning in 3D space.
  why_it_matters: |
    VR audio is often critical to the experience. Without captions, deaf and
    hard-of-hearing users miss dialogue, environmental cues, and spatial
    audio information. VR captions require special consideration for 3D space.
  when_to_run:
  - During accessibility review
  - Before launch
  - When adding audio content
  - After caption feedback

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SCS-CRIT-001
    signal: No captions for critical audio
    evidence_indicators:
    - Dialogue not captioned
    - Important sounds uncaptioned
    - No caption system exists
    explanation: |
      Without captions, deaf users cannot understand dialogue or
      important audio cues essential to the experience.
    remediation: Implement caption system for all audio
  - id: SCS-CRIT-002
    signal: Captions unreadable in VR
    evidence_indicators:
    - Text too small
    - Captions lost in environment
    - Positioning unusable
    explanation: |
      Captions must be readable in VR context. Standard 2D caption
      approaches may not work in 3D space.
    remediation: Design VR-appropriate caption presentation
  high:
  - id: SCS-HIGH-001
    signal: No speaker identification
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot tell who is speaking
    - Multiple speakers unlabeled
    remediation: Add speaker identification in captions
  - id: SCS-HIGH-002
    signal: Environmental sounds not captioned
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only dialogue captioned
    - Important sounds missed
    remediation: Add environmental sound captions
  medium:
  - id: SCS-MED-001
    signal: Caption position not user-adjustable
    remediation: Allow caption position adjustment
  - id: SCS-MED-002
    signal: Caption styling limited
    remediation: Add caption size, color, background options
  low:
  - id: SCS-LOW-001
    signal: Caption timing slightly off
    remediation: Improve caption synchronization
  positive:
  - id: SCS-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive captions
