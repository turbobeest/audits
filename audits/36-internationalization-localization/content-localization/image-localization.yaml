description:
  what: |
    Evaluates localization of images including text in images, screenshots,
    culturally appropriate imagery, image alt text, and locale-specific
    visual content. Examines whether images are served based on locale
    and contain localized text where needed.
  why_it_matters: |
    Images with embedded text cannot be translated without new images.
    Screenshots showing English UI to German users create disconnection.
    Proper image localization ensures visual content supports the localized
    experience.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching in new markets
  - When auditing visual content
  - After adding new locales
  - During marketing localization

signals:
  critical:
  - id: I18N-IMG-CRIT-001
    signal: Hardcoded text in images not localized
    evidence_indicators:
    - English text visible in images for all locales
    - Buttons/labels in images untranslated
    explanation: |
      Text in images cannot be translated at runtime, leaving
      users seeing foreign language text.
    remediation: Create localized image variants or use CSS/SVG
  - id: I18N-IMG-CRIT-002
    signal: Screenshots show wrong locale UI
    evidence_indicators:
    - Help screenshots in English for all locales
    - Tutorial images show wrong language
    explanation: |
      Screenshots in wrong language confuse users and make
      instructions hard to follow.
    remediation: Create screenshots in each supported locale
  high:
  - id: I18N-IMG-HIGH-001
    signal: Image alt text not translated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Alt text in English for all locales
    - Missing localized alt attributes
    remediation: Translate all image alt text
  - id: I18N-IMG-HIGH-002
    signal: SVG text not localized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Text elements in SVG hardcoded
    - SVG text not using translation system
    remediation: Make SVG text translatable or create variants
  medium:
  - id: I18N-IMG-MED-001
    signal: No locale-specific image serving
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same images served regardless of locale
    - No image localization infrastructure
    remediation: Implement locale-aware image serving
  - id: I18N-IMG-MED-002
    signal: Marketing images not localized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Hero images, banners with English text
    - Promotional imagery not adapted

    signal: Image filenames not localized
    remediation: Consider locale in image URLs for SEO
  - id: I18N-IMG-LOW-002
    signal: Decorative images have unnecessary alt text
    remediation: Use empty alt for decorative images
  positive:
