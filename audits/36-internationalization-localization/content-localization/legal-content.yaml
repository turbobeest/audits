description:
  what: |
    Evaluates localization and adaptation of legal content including Terms
    of Service, Privacy Policies, Cookie notices, compliance disclosures,
    and regulatory content. Examines whether legal content is properly
    translated and adapted for each jurisdiction.
  why_it_matters: |
    Legal content must be accurate and jurisdiction-appropriate. Many regions
    require legal documents in local language. Incorrect translations of
    legal terms can create liability, compliance violations, and render
    agreements unenforceable.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching in new jurisdictions
  - When updating legal documents
  - During compliance audits
  - After regulatory changes
