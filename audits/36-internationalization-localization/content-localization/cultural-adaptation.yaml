description:
  what: |
    Evaluates cultural appropriateness of content beyond translation,
    including imagery, colors, symbols, examples, metaphors, and references.
    Examines whether content resonates with target cultures and avoids
    culturally insensitive or confusing elements.
  why_it_matters: |
    Cultural missteps can offend users, damage brand reputation, and reduce
    engagement. A thumbs-up emoji is offensive in some cultures, white
    symbolizes death in others. Truly localized content connects with
    users culturally, not just linguistically.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching in new markets
  - During brand localization
  - When creating marketing content
  - After cultural feedback received
