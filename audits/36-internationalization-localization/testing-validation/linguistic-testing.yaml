description:
  what: |
    Evaluates linguistic quality testing of translations in context including
    contextual accuracy, consistency, terminology adherence, style compliance,
    and cultural appropriateness. Examines in-context review processes and
    linguistic quality assurance procedures.
  why_it_matters: |
    Translations that look correct in isolation may be wrong in context.
    A button labeled "Run" could mean "execute" or "physical running" -
    context determines correct translation. Linguistic testing catches
    these contextual errors.
  when_to_run:
  - After receiving translations
  - Before major releases
  - When updating translations
  - During localization QA

  - id: I18N-LING-CRIT-001
    signal: No in-context linguistic review
    evidence_indicators:
    - Translations only reviewed in spreadsheet
    - No UI-based review process
    explanation: |
      Without in-context review, contextual mistranslations and
      UI issues go undetected.
    remediation: Implement in-context review process
  - id: I18N-LING-CRIT-002
    signal: Critical mistranslations found
    evidence_indicators:
    - Meaning changed by translation
    - Safety/legal content mistranslated
    explanation: |
      Critical mistranslations can cause harm, liability, or
      significant user confusion.
