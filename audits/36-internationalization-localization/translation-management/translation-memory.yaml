description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the utilization, quality, and management of Translation Memory
    (TM) assets. Examines TM coverage, leverage rates, maintenance practices,
    quality of stored translations, and integration with translation workflows.
  why_it_matters: |
    Translation Memory reduces costs by reusing previous translations, ensures
    consistency across content, and speeds up translation turnaround. Poor TM
    management leads to wasted resources and inconsistent translations.
  when_to_run:
  - When evaluating localization ROI
  - After significant content updates
  - When changing TMS platforms
  - During cost optimization reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: I18N-TM-CRIT-001
    signal: No Translation Memory in use
    evidence_indicators:
    - All translations done from scratch
    - No TM files or TMS TM storage
    explanation: |
      Without TM, every translation is done from scratch, dramatically
      increasing costs and inconsistency.
    remediation: Implement TM system immediately
  high:
  - id: I18N-TM-HIGH-001
    signal: Low TM leverage rates (<50%)
    evidence_indicators:
    - Most content flagged as new
    - High translation costs despite stable content
    remediation: Improve TM coverage and matching thresholds
  - id: I18N-TM-HIGH-002
    signal: Corrupted or low-quality TM entries
    evidence_indicators:
    - Invalid or misaligned TM segments
    - Outdated translations in TM
    remediation: Clean and maintain TM regularly
  medium:
  - id: I18N-TM-MED-001
    signal: TM not shared across projects
    evidence_indicators:
    - Separate TM per project with no central TM
    - Same translations stored multiple times
    remediation: Implement centralized TM strategy
  - id: I18N-TM-MED-002
    signal: No TM maintenance process
    evidence_indicators:
    - TM never cleaned or updated
    - No process for TM quality review
    remediation: Establish regular TM maintenance schedule
  low:
  - id: I18N-TM-LOW-001
    signal: Suboptimal TM matching settings
    remediation: Tune fuzzy matching thresholds for better leverage
  - id: I18N-TM-LOW-002
    signal: TM not backed up regularly
    remediation: Implement TM backup strategy
  positive:
  - id: I18N-TM-POS-001
    signal: High TM leverage rates (>80%)
  - id: I18N-TM-POS-002
    signal: Regular TM maintenance and quality reviews
