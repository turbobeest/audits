description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the integration between the application codebase and the
    Translation Management System (TMS). Examines API connections, sync
    mechanisms, webhook configurations, and data flow between development
    and translation environments.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor TMS integration leads to manual overhead, sync errors, and delays
    in the translation pipeline. Proper integration enables continuous
    localization and reduces time-to-market for international releases.
  when_to_run:
  - When setting up new TMS integration
  - After TMS platform changes
  - When troubleshooting sync issues
  - During localization infrastructure review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: I18N-TMS-CRIT-001
    signal: TMS credentials exposed in repository
    evidence_indicators:
    - API keys hardcoded in configuration files
    - Credentials committed to version control
    explanation: |
      Exposed credentials can lead to unauthorized access to translation
      assets and potential data breaches.
    remediation: Move credentials to secure environment variables
  high:
  - id: I18N-TMS-HIGH-001
    signal: Sync failures not detected or alerted
    evidence_indicators:
    - Silent sync failures
    - No monitoring on TMS integration
    remediation: Implement sync monitoring and alerting
  - id: I18N-TMS-HIGH-002
    signal: Bidirectional sync causing overwrites
    evidence_indicators:
    - Developer changes overwritten by TMS sync
    - Translator changes lost on code push
    remediation: Configure proper sync direction and conflict resolution
  medium:
  - id: I18N-TMS-MED-001
    signal: Manual sync required instead of automation
    evidence_indicators:
    - CLI commands run manually
    - No webhook or scheduled sync
    remediation: Automate sync via CI/CD or webhooks
  - id: I18N-TMS-MED-002
    signal: Incomplete file mapping configuration
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some translation files not synced
    - Missing file type mappings
    remediation: Update configuration to include all translation files
  low:
  - id: I18N-TMS-LOW-001
    signal: Sync runs more frequently than necessary
    remediation: Optimize sync frequency for cost and performance
  - id: I18N-TMS-LOW-002
    signal: Unused TMS features not leveraged
    remediation: Evaluate and enable beneficial TMS features
  positive:
  - id: I18N-TMS-POS-001
    signal: Fully automated bidirectional sync configured
  - id: I18N-TMS-POS-002
    signal: TMS integrated with development workflow
