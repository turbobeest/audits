description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the efficiency and effectiveness of the translation workflow
    including handoff processes, turnaround times, automation levels,
    tooling integration, and bottleneck identification. Analyzes how
    translations flow from development to deployment.
  why_it_matters: |
    Inefficient translation workflows delay releases, increase costs, and
    create friction between development and localization teams. Optimized
    workflows enable faster international launches and reduce localization
    overhead.
  when_to_run:
  - When evaluating localization maturity
  - Before scaling to new markets
  - After experiencing localization delays
  - During process improvement initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: I18N-FLOW-CRIT-001
    signal: No defined translation workflow
    evidence_indicators:
    - Ad-hoc translation processes
    - Manual file transfers via email
    explanation: |
      Without a defined workflow, translations are error-prone,
      inconsistent, and cannot scale effectively.
    remediation: Establish formalized translation workflow
  high:
  - id: I18N-FLOW-HIGH-001
    signal: Manual string extraction and handoff
    evidence_indicators:
    - Developers manually copying strings to spreadsheets
    - No automated sync between code and TMS
    remediation: Implement automated string extraction pipeline
  - id: I18N-FLOW-HIGH-002
    signal: Translation bottleneck blocking releases
    evidence_indicators:
    - Releases delayed waiting for translations
    - Long translation turnaround times (>1 week)
    remediation: Parallelize translation with development
  medium:
  - id: I18N-FLOW-MED-001
    signal: No translation memory utilization
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same strings translated repeatedly
    - No TM or TMS in use
    remediation: Implement translation memory system
  - id: I18N-FLOW-MED-002
    signal: Lack of context for translators
    evidence_indicators:
    - No screenshots or UI context provided
    - Translators working without context
    remediation: Provide context, screenshots, and descriptions
  low:
  - id: I18N-FLOW-LOW-001
    signal: Suboptimal translator assignment
    remediation: Implement skill-based translator routing
  - id: I18N-FLOW-LOW-002
    signal: Manual QA processes that could be automated
    remediation: Add automated QA checks to workflow
  positive:
  - id: I18N-FLOW-POS-001
    signal: Continuous localization pipeline in place
  - id: I18N-FLOW-POS-002
    signal: Translation integrated into CI/CD
