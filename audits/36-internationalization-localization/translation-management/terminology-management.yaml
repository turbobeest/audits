description:
  what: |
    Evaluates terminology management practices including glossary existence,
    completeness, maintenance processes, and enforcement in translations.
    Examines brand terms, product names, technical vocabulary, and
    domain-specific terminology across all locales.
  why_it_matters: |
    Consistent terminology builds brand identity and user trust. Inconsistent
    terms confuse users, damage professionalism, and can cause compliance
    issues in regulated industries. Good terminology management reduces
    translation costs through reuse.
  when_to_run:
  - When establishing localization program
  - Before adding new product lines
  - When onboarding new translators
  - During brand refresh initiatives
