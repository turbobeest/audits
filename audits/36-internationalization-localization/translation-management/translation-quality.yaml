description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the linguistic and contextual quality of translations including
    accuracy, fluency, consistency, terminology adherence, and cultural
    appropriateness. Identifies machine translation artifacts, grammatical
    errors, and mistranslations that could impact user experience.
  why_it_matters: |
    Poor translation quality damages brand credibility, confuses users, and
    can lead to misunderstandings or legal issues in regulated industries.
    Quality translations build trust and improve conversion rates in
    international markets.
  when_to_run:
  - After receiving translations from vendors
  - Before major international releases
  - When switching translation providers
  - During localization QA cycles
