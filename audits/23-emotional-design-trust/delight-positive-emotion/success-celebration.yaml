  what: |
    Evaluates how the application celebrates user achievements, task completions,
    and milestones. Examines the appropriateness, timing, and emotional impact
    of success feedback including completion animations, congratulatory messages,
    achievement badges, progress celebrations, and milestone acknowledgments.
    Assesses whether celebrations are proportional to accomplishment significance
    and culturally appropriate.
  why_it_matters: |
    Positive reinforcement through success celebration:
    - Increases dopamine release, creating positive product associations
    - Improves task completion rates by 23% (gamification research)
    - Builds habit formation through variable reward patterns
    - Creates memorable moments that users share and recall
    - Differentiates products in saturated markets

    However, excessive or mismatched celebration creates the opposite effect:
    - Condescending celebrations for trivial tasks annoy users
    - Missing celebrations for significant achievements feel hollow
    - Generic celebrations signal lack of personalization
  when_to_run:
  - During onboarding flow optimization
  - When implementing gamification features
  - After user feedback about 'feeling unrewarded'
  - Before launching achievement or progression systems
  - During competitive UX benchmarking

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CELEB-CRIT-001
    signal: No feedback for major achievements
    evidence_indicators:
    - Onboarding completion has no celebration
    - First purchase or conversion lacks acknowledgment
    - Major milestones pass without recognition
    - Users express feeling unrewarded
    explanation: |
      Major achievements without celebration are missed opportunities
      to create positive associations and reinforce behavior. Users
      invest significant effort in milestones and expect recognition.
    remediation: |
      - Map all major milestones in user journey
      - Design proportional celebrations for each
      - Include visual, textual, and potentially auditory feedback
      - Consider shareable celebration moments
  - id: CELEB-CRIT-002
    signal: Celebrations are condescending or excessive for trivial actions
    evidence_indicators:
    - Confetti for routine data entry
    - Over-enthusiastic praise for minor actions
    - Users report feeling patronized
    - Celebration fatigue observed in user testing
    explanation: |
      Disproportionate celebration undermines credibility and annoys
      users. "Good job!" for clicking a button trains users to dismiss
      all feedback, including meaningful celebrations.
    remediation: |
      - Audit all celebrations for proportionality
      - Reserve substantial celebrations for meaningful moments
      - Use subtle confirmations for routine actions
      - Test celebration intensity with target users
  high:
  - id: CELEB-HIGH-001
    signal: Celebration timing is wrong
    evidence_indicators:
    - Celebration appears before action completes
    - Success feedback delayed, creating uncertainty
    - Celebration interrupts task flow
    - Users miss celebrations due to timing
    explanation: |
      Celebration must occur at the right moment - after confirmed
      success but before user moves on. Premature celebration on
      failed actions destroys trust; delayed celebration loses impact.
    remediation: |
      - Ensure celebrations trigger after confirmed success
      - Display within 500ms of completion
      - Avoid interrupting subsequent task flow
      - Don't block user from continuing
  - id: CELEB-HIGH-002
    signal: Celebrations are generic and impersonal
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same celebration for all achievement types
    - No personalization in congratulatory messages
    - No acknowledgment of effort or progress
    - Celebrations feel automated and hollow
    explanation: |
      Generic celebrations signal that the product doesn't recognize
      individual users. Personalized celebration ("You've written
      50 documents, Alex!") creates connection and recognition.
    remediation: |
      - Add user name to celebration messages
      - Reference specific achievement details
      - Acknowledge progress and comparison to history
      - Vary celebration content to prevent repetition
  - id: CELEB-HIGH-003
    signal: Celebrations inaccessible to some users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Celebrations rely solely on animation
    - No text alternative for visual celebrations
    - Motion-heavy celebrations ignore reduced motion
    - Audio celebrations have no visual equivalent
    explanation: |
      Celebrations that exclude users with disabilities create
      negative experiences for those users. Success should be
      equally celebratory for all users.
    remediation: |
      - Provide text confirmation alongside animations
      - Support prefers-reduced-motion preference
      - Include visual feedback with audio celebrations
      - Test with assistive technologies
  medium:
  - id: CELEB-MED-001
    signal: No celebration variety or surprise
    evidence_indicators:
    - Identical celebration every time
    - Predictable patterns become background noise
    - No variable reward elements
    remediation: |
      - Introduce variety in celebration animations
      - Add surprise elements for continued engagement
      - Use variable reward schedules for habits
  - id: CELEB-MED-002
    signal: Celebrations not shareable
    evidence_indicators:
    - No social sharing for achievements
    - Screenshots of achievements look poor
    - Milestone moments not designed for sharing
    remediation: |
      - Add social sharing options for major achievements
      - Design celebrations to look good when screenshot
      - Create shareable achievement cards or images
  - id: CELEB-MED-003
    signal: Progress celebrations missing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only final completion is celebrated
    - No encouragement during long tasks
    - Progress milestones (25%, 50%, 75%) ignored
    remediation: |
      - Add progress milestone celebrations
      - Provide encouragement during lengthy processes
      - Show progress visualization with positive framing
  low:
  - id: CELEB-LOW-001
    signal: Celebration branding inconsistent
    evidence_indicators:
    - Celebration style doesn't match brand
    - Tone of voice shifts in celebrations
    - Visual style inconsistent with design system
    remediation: |
      - Align celebrations with brand personality
      - Use consistent tone of voice
      - Follow design system for celebration components
  positive:
  - id: CELEB-POS-001
