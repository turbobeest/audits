  what: |
    Evaluates the presence and effectiveness of unexpected positive moments
    throughout the user experience. Surprise and delight features are
    intentional design elements that exceed user expectations: Easter eggs,
    delightful animations, thoughtful copy, unexpected rewards, personality
    moments, and small touches that spark joy. This audit assesses whether
    these elements exist, are appropriately placed, and contribute to
    positive brand perception without becoming annoying.
  why_it_matters: |
    Research on customer experience shows that emotional peaks strongly
    influence memory and loyalty (Peak-End Rule):
    - Unexpected positive moments create 2-3x stronger memories than expected ones
    - Users are 60% more likely to recommend products that "delighted" them
    - Small delightful touches differentiate commodity products
    - Shareability of delightful moments provides organic marketing

    However, poorly executed surprise and delight:
    - Feels forced or corporate when inauthentic
    - Wastes user time when blocking workflow
    - Becomes annoying through repetition
    - May be culturally inappropriate
  when_to_run:
  - During brand differentiation initiatives
  - When user feedback feels 'meh' despite functionality
  - Before product launches seeking viral potential
  - During competitive UX benchmarking
  - When employee engagement with product is low

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DELIGHT-CRIT-001
    signal: Interface is purely utilitarian with no personality
    evidence_indicators:
    - All copy is strictly functional
    - No illustrations, animations, or visual personality
    - Zero instances of unexpected positive moments
    - User feedback describes product as 'boring' or 'sterile'
    explanation: |
      Products that meet functional needs but offer no emotional
      connection are highly substitutable. In competitive markets,
      delight differentiates and creates loyalty.
    remediation: |
      - Audit brand personality traits and identify expression opportunities
      - Start with high-impact, low-effort delight (empty states, microcopy)
      - Introduce personality gradually to maintain brand coherence
      - Measure impact on user sentiment and engagement
  high:
  - id: DELIGHT-HIGH-001
    signal: Delight features interrupt user workflow
    evidence_indicators:
    - Surprise elements block task completion
    - Animations delay users who need efficiency
    - Easter eggs trigger accidentally during work
    - Users express frustration with 'cutesy' features
    explanation: |
      Delight should enhance, not impede. Features that prioritize
      delight over utility fail the fundamental usability test.
      Delight must be optional or non-blocking.
    remediation: |
      - Make delight features skippable or dismissible
      - Don't block workflow with animations
      - Place Easter eggs in non-critical paths
      - Respect user's time-on-task needs
  - id: DELIGHT-HIGH-002
    signal: Delight attempts feel forced or inauthentic
    evidence_indicators:
    - Personality feels misaligned with brand
    - Attempts at humor feel corporate or try-hard
    - Users describe delight features as 'cringe'
    - Delight inconsistent with overall experience
    explanation: |
      Forced delight is worse than no delight. Users detect
      inauthenticity instantly, and insincere attempts damage
      brand trust more than a neutral experience would.
    remediation: |
      - Align delight with genuine brand personality
      - User test delight features with target audience
      - Let delight emerge naturally from design principles
      - Avoid trends that don't fit brand
  - id: DELIGHT-HIGH-003
    signal: Delight features culturally inappropriate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Humor that doesn't translate internationally
    - References that exclude non-Western users
    - Imagery inappropriate in some cultures
    - Language that may offend certain groups
    explanation: |
      Delight features that work in one culture may confuse or
      offend in another. Global products need culturally-aware
      delight or localized approaches.
    remediation: |
      - Review delight features for cultural sensitivity
      - Consider localized delight for different markets
      - Test with users from target cultures
      - Avoid humor that relies on cultural specifics
  medium:
  - id: DELIGHT-MED-001
    signal: Delight opportunities missed in key moments
    evidence_indicators:
    - Empty states are plain error-like screens
    - Loading states are generic spinners
    - Milestone moments lack any celebration
    - Error pages purely functional
    remediation: |
      - Redesign empty states with personality and guidance
      - Create delightful loading experiences
      - Add unexpected positive moments to milestones
      - Transform 404 and error pages into brand moments
  - id: DELIGHT-MED-002
    signal: Delight features have no variety
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same delight feature repeated without variation
    - Easter eggs discovered once lose impact
    - No seasonal or contextual delight updates
    remediation: |
      - Introduce variety in repeatable delight moments
      - Add seasonal or contextual surprises
      - Rotate delight content to maintain freshness
  low:
  - id: DELIGHT-LOW-001
    signal: No documentation of delight strategy
    evidence_indicators:
    - Delight features added ad-hoc
    - No guidelines for where delight is appropriate
    - Inconsistent delight across product areas
    remediation: |
      - Document delight philosophy in design system
      - Create guidelines for appropriate delight placement
      - Establish review process for delight features
