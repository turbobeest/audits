  what: |
    Evaluates the design and emotional quality of empty states throughout the
    application. Empty states occur when there's no data to display: new user
    screens, search results with no matches, filtered views with nothing,
    cleared lists, and error states that result in no content. This audit
    assesses whether these moments are handled with warmth, guidance, and
    encouragement rather than stark blankness or discouraging messages.
  why_it_matters: |
    Empty states are critical emotional moments:
    - First-time users encounter empty states before seeing value
    - Empty results after search feel like failure without good design
    - Blank screens create anxiety about whether the app works
    - Well-designed empty states convert to action 40% more than blank ones

    Poor empty states:
    - Make new users question if signup was worth it
    - Provide no guidance on what to do next
    - Feel cold and uninviting
    - Miss opportunity to reinforce brand personality
  when_to_run:
  - During new user onboarding optimization
  - When activation rates are below benchmark
  - After adding new features with empty initial states
  - During design system completeness audits
  - When user feedback mentions confusion

signals:
  critical:
  - id: EMPTY-CRIT-001
    signal: Empty states are completely blank
    evidence_indicators:
    - Screen shows nothing when no data exists
    - No explanation of why screen is empty
    - No guidance on what to do next
    - User might think app is broken
    explanation: |
      Completely blank screens leave users confused about whether
      the app is working and what they should do. This is especially
      damaging for new users who haven't yet seen value.
    remediation: |
      - Design explicit empty state for every data-dependent screen
      - Include clear explanation of the empty state
      - Provide primary action to populate the screen
      - Add visual element (illustration) to indicate intentional state
  - id: EMPTY-CRIT-002
    signal: First-time user states discourage action
    evidence_indicators:
    - Empty state language is negative ('No items', 'Nothing here')
    - No value proposition for adding content
    - CTA unclear or missing
    - First impression feels cold or broken
    explanation: |
      New users' first encounter with the product is often an empty
      state. If this moment feels unwelcoming, activation suffers.
      This is a critical moment for emotional connection.
    remediation: |
      - Reframe empty state copy positively
      - Communicate value of adding first item
      - Make primary action prominent and inviting
      - Add illustration that matches brand personality
  high:
  - id: EMPTY-HIGH-001
    signal: No search results state unhelpful
    evidence_indicators:
    - Just says 'No results' with no guidance
    - No suggestions for alternative searches
    - No option to broaden search or clear filters
    - User feels dead-ended
    explanation: |
      Finding nothing after searching is frustrating. Without
      guidance, users may assume content doesn't exist when
      it might just need a different query.
    remediation: |
      - Acknowledge the search attempt
      - Suggest query modifications
      - Offer related content if available
      - Provide clear path to try again
  - id: EMPTY-HIGH-002
    signal: Empty states inconsistent across product
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some areas have designed empty states, others blank
    - Different illustration styles in different areas
    - Copy tone varies across empty states
    - No design system pattern for empty states
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent empty states signal unfinished product and
      create unpredictable user experience. Users can't build
      mental model of how the app communicates.
    remediation: |
      - Create design system component for empty states
      - Standardize illustration style and tone
      - Audit all empty states for consistency
      - Apply pattern across product
  - id: EMPTY-HIGH-003
    signal: Empty state has no clear action
    evidence_indicators:
    - Empty state explains situation but provides no CTA
    - Action to populate is not obvious
    - User must navigate away to create content
    - Primary action buried or absent
    explanation: |
      Empty states should guide users to the next step. Without
      clear action, users may not know how to proceed or may
      abandon the flow.
    remediation: |
      - Add prominent primary CTA to empty states
      - Enable inline creation where possible
      - Make action copy specific ("Add your first project")
      - Consider secondary actions for alternative paths
  medium:
  - id: EMPTY-MED-001
    signal: Empty states lack personality
    evidence_indicators:
    - Generic placeholder text
    - No illustrations or visual interest
    - Functional but cold
    - Missed brand expression opportunity
    remediation: |
      - Add brand-appropriate illustrations
      - Write copy with brand voice
      - Use empty states as personality moments
      - Consider delightful touches
  - id: EMPTY-MED-002
    signal: Empty filter results don't show active filters
    evidence_indicators:
    - User filtered to zero results but can't see why
    - No indication of which filters are limiting
    - Clear filters action not visible
    remediation: |
      - Show active filters in empty state
      - Provide one-click filter clear
      - Suggest which filter to adjust
  - id: EMPTY-MED-003
    signal: Completed/cleared empty state not celebratory
    evidence_indicators:
    - Zero inbox state just says 'No messages'
    - Completed task list shows blank
    - Achievement of clearing items not acknowledged
    remediation: |
      - Celebrate completion ("All done!", "Inbox zero!")
      - Acknowledge achievement positively
      - Suggest what to do next
  low:
  - id: EMPTY-LOW-001
    signal: Empty state illustrations not responsive
    evidence_indicators:
    - Illustrations too large on mobile
    - Illustrations disappear on small screens
    - Layout breaks in empty states
    remediation: |
      - Ensure responsive empty state design
      - Scale illustrations appropriately
      - Test on all viewport sizes
  positive:
  - id: EMPTY-POS-001
    signal: Empty states are inviting and actionable

    - Clear explanation and value proposition
    - Prominent action to populate
    - Warm, on-brand personality

    evidence_indicators:
    - Design system pattern used consistently
    - All empty states follow same structure
    - Illustration and tone consistent
  - id: EMPTY-POS-003
    signal: Context-appropriate empty states
    evidence_indicators:
