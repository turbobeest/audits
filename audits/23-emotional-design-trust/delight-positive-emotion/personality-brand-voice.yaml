  what: |
    Evaluates how consistently and effectively brand personality comes through
    in the product interface. Examines microcopy (button text, labels, tooltips),
    longer-form content (onboarding, help, empty states), error messages,
    notifications, and marketing-to-product transitions. Assesses whether the
    voice is consistent, appropriate to context, and creates the intended
    emotional connection with users.
  why_it_matters: |
    Brand voice in product interfaces:
    - Creates emotional differentiation in commodity categories
    - Builds trust through consistent personality expression
    - Reduces cognitive load when voice is predictable
    - Increases perceived value and justifies premium pricing
    - Creates word-of-mouth when copy is memorable

    Inconsistent or inappropriate voice:
    - Confuses users about brand identity
    - Can feel jarring when tone shifts unexpectedly
    - Undermines trust when serious moments feel flippant
    - Alienates users when personality doesn't resonate
  when_to_run:
  - After brand refresh or rebrand
  - During design system voice/tone definition
  - When user feedback mentions confusing messaging
  - Before international expansion (voice localization)
  - When combining products from acquisitions

signals:
  critical:
  - id: VOICE-CRIT-001
    signal: Voice radically inconsistent across product
    evidence_indicators:
    - Marketing voice doesn't match product voice
    - Different product areas feel like different brands
    - Tone swings wildly (formal to casual without reason)
    - Acquired products retain old voice within platform
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent voice confuses brand identity and reduces trust.
      Users question whether they're using the same product when
      voice changes unexpectedly between areas.
    remediation: |
      - Audit all content against voice guidelines
      - Create voice alignment project across product
      - Establish review process for voice consistency
      - Update legacy content to current voice
  - id: VOICE-CRIT-002
    signal: Voice inappropriate for serious contexts
    evidence_indicators:
    - Flippant error messages for critical failures
    - Overly casual tone in security contexts
    - Humor in data loss or financial error scenarios
    - Users report feeling dismissed or mocked
    explanation: |
      While personality is valuable, some contexts require serious
      treatment. Using playful voice when users face problems feels
      dismissive and damages trust in critical moments.
    remediation: |
      - Define tone modulation guide by context severity
      - Review all error and failure messages
      - Test serious-context copy with users
      - Ensure empathy comes before personality
  high:
  - id: VOICE-HIGH-001
    signal: No voice guidelines exist
    evidence_indicators:
    - No documented brand voice attributes
    - Writers/designers make ad-hoc voice decisions
    - Voice varies by who wrote the content
    - No reference for appropriate voice
    explanation: |
      Without voice guidelines, consistency is impossible. Each
      contributor brings their own interpretation, creating a
      fragmented experience.
    remediation: |
      - Develop brand voice documentation
      - Define 3-5 voice attributes with examples
      - Create tone modulation guidance by context
      - Socialize guidelines with all content creators
  - id: VOICE-HIGH-002
    signal: Voice not adapted for context
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same tone in onboarding and critical errors
    - No modulation between casual and serious moments
    - Playful voice even in financial/security contexts
    - Formal voice even in celebration moments
    explanation: |
      Voice should be consistent but tone should adapt. A brand
      can be friendly in onboarding and still appropriately serious
      when discussing security. Missing this nuance feels robotic.
    remediation: |
      - Define tone spectrum (from serious to playful)
      - Map contexts to appropriate tone levels
      - Create examples for each tone level
      - Review content for context-appropriate tone
  - id: VOICE-HIGH-003
    signal: Voice alienates target users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Overly technical voice for consumer audience
    - Too casual voice for enterprise users
    - Jargon-heavy content without explanation
    - User feedback about feeling talked down to or excluded
    explanation: |
      Voice must resonate with target audience. Enterprise software
      using startup-casual voice may feel unprofessional; consumer
      apps with corporate voice may feel cold.
    remediation: |
      - Align voice with user persona expectations
      - Test voice samples with target users
      - Adjust formality to audience preferences
      - Eliminate exclusionary jargon
  medium:
  - id: VOICE-MED-001
    signal: Microcopy generic and lacking personality
    evidence_indicators:
    - All buttons say 'Submit', 'Cancel', 'OK'
    - Help text is purely instructional
    - No personality in functional interface text
    remediation: |
      - Audit high-visibility microcopy for personality opportunities
      - Create more specific, action-oriented button text
      - Add personality to tooltips and help text where appropriate
  - id: VOICE-MED-002
    signal: Voice not maintained after launch
    evidence_indicators:
    - New features have inconsistent voice
    - No voice review in design/content process
    - Voice drift over time
    remediation: |
      - Add voice review to content approval process
      - Include voice guidelines in design handoffs
      - Conduct periodic voice audits
  - id: VOICE-MED-003
    signal: Translation/localization loses voice
    evidence_indicators:
    - Localized content is more generic than source
    - Personality doesn't survive translation
    - Different markets have different voice
    remediation: |
      - Create localization voice guidelines
      - Work with native speakers who understand brand
      - Review localized content for voice preservation
  low:
  - id: VOICE-LOW-001
    signal: Voice guidelines exist but are underused
    evidence_indicators:
    - Guidelines documented but not referenced
    - New team members unaware of guidelines
    - Guidelines not updated as brand evolves
    remediation: |
      - Make guidelines easily accessible
      - Include in onboarding for relevant roles
      - Review and update guidelines regularly

  - id: VOICE-POS-002
    signal: Appropriate tone modulation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Personality in appropriate moments
    - Seriousness in error/security contexts
    - Tone matches context appropriately
  - id: VOICE-POS-003
