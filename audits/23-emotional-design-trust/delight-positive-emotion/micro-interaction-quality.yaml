  what: |
    Evaluates the quality, consistency, and emotional impact of micro-interactions
    throughout the user interface. Micro-interactions are small, contained moments
    centered around a single task: button hover states, loading animations, form
    field feedback, toggle switches, scroll behaviors, and notification appearances.
    This audit assesses whether these details create moments of delight while
    remaining functional, accessible, and performance-conscious.
  why_it_matters: |
    Research from Nielsen Norman Group shows that well-designed micro-interactions:
    - Increase perceived system responsiveness by up to 40%
    - Reduce user errors through immediate visual feedback
    - Create emotional bonds that improve brand perception
    - Differentiate products in competitive markets
    - Signal quality and attention to detail that transfers to trust in the product

    Conversely, absent or poorly designed micro-interactions make interfaces feel
    "dead" or unresponsive, increasing cognitive load and abandonment rates.
  when_to_run:
  - During design system maturity assessments
  - Before major product launches
  - When user feedback mentions 'feeling' or responsiveness issues
  - After migrating to new frontend frameworks
  - During competitive UX benchmarking

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MICRO-CRIT-001
    signal: Interactive elements have no feedback states
    evidence_indicators:
    - Buttons show no visual change on hover or click
    - Form fields have no focus indication
    - Users uncertain if clicks were registered
    - Accessibility audit fails for focus visibility
    explanation: |
      Elements without feedback states create uncertainty about whether
      actions were received. This is both a usability issue (users click
      repeatedly) and an accessibility failure (WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible).
    remediation: |
      - Implement hover, focus, and active states for all interactive elements
      - Ensure focus states meet WCAG contrast requirements
      - Provide immediate visual feedback within 100ms of interaction
      - Test with keyboard-only navigation
  - id: MICRO-CRIT-002
    signal: No loading feedback for async operations
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clicks on buttons produce no immediate response
    - Forms submit with no indication of processing
    - Users uncertain if action is in progress
    - Multiple form submissions from user uncertainty
    explanation: |
      Users expect response within 100ms. Operations taking longer need
      immediate feedback (spinner, disabled state) to prevent anxiety
      and duplicate submissions. Research shows 1 second is the limit
      for maintaining flow of thought.
    remediation: |
      - Show loading indicator within 100ms of action initiation
      - Disable submit buttons during processing
      - Use skeleton screens for content loading >1 second
      - Provide progress indication for operations >3 seconds
  high:
  - id: MICRO-HIGH-001
    signal: Animations cause performance jank
    evidence_indicators:
    - Animations run below 60fps
    - Scrolling stutters during animations
    - CPU spikes during transitions
    - User reports of 'laggy' interface
    explanation: |
      Animations that drop below 60fps create perceptible jank that
      undermines the polish they're meant to add. Janky animations
      are worse than no animations at all.
    remediation: |
      - Profile animations with DevTools Performance panel
      - Use CSS transforms and opacity for animations (GPU-accelerated)
      - Avoid animating layout properties (width, height, top, left)
      - Consider reducing animation complexity on lower-powered devices
  - id: MICRO-HIGH-002
    signal: Reduced motion preference not respected
    evidence_indicators:
    - Animations play regardless of prefers-reduced-motion setting
    - No alternative experience for motion-sensitive users
    - Vestibular disorder triggers not considered
    explanation: |
      Users with vestibular disorders, motion sensitivity, or attention
      disorders can experience physical discomfort from animations.
      WCAG 2.3.3 requires respecting user preferences.
    remediation: |
      - Implement prefers-reduced-motion media query support
      - Replace motion with instant state changes when preference set
      - Provide user-facing animation toggle in settings
      - Test all flows with reduced motion enabled
  - id: MICRO-HIGH-003
    signal: Inconsistent interaction patterns across interface
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different hover effects on similar buttons
    - Varying animation timings throughout application
    - Some elements have feedback, others don't
    - Design system interaction specs not followed
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent micro-interactions increase cognitive load as users
      must learn different patterns for similar actions. This undermines
      the efficiency that good design should provide.
    remediation: |
      - Audit all interactive elements for consistency
      - Establish standard timing and easing in design system
      - Create reusable interaction components
      - Implement linting or review processes for consistency
  medium:
  - id: MICRO-MED-001
    signal: Animation timing feels unnatural
    evidence_indicators:
    - Linear easing used for UI transitions
    - Animations too fast to perceive or too slow to tolerate
    - Elements pop in/out without transition
    - Timing doesn't match user expectations
    remediation: |
      - Use natural easing curves (ease-out for entering, ease-in for exiting)
      - Duration: 150-300ms for most UI animations
      - Follow material design or Apple HIG motion principles
      - Test timing with representative users
  - id: MICRO-MED-002
    signal: No visual feedback for successful actions
    evidence_indicators:
    - Save operations complete silently
    - Settings changes have no confirmation
    - Users uncertain if their action succeeded
    remediation: |
      - Add success confirmations (toast, checkmark, color change)
      - Use subtle celebrations for meaningful milestones
      - Ensure feedback is accessible (not color-only)
  - id: MICRO-MED-003
    signal: Scroll-linked animations cause disorientation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Parallax effects cause motion sickness reports
    - Content movement during scroll is disorienting
    - Scroll hijacking changes expected behavior
    remediation: |
      - Limit parallax and scroll-linked animations
      - Respect reduced motion preferences for scroll effects
      - Avoid scroll hijacking that overrides native behavior
  low:
  - id: MICRO-LOW-001
    signal: Micro-interactions lack personality
    evidence_indicators:
    - All animations are generic/default
    - No brand-differentiating motion patterns
    - Interface feels utilitarian but not delightful
    remediation: |
      - Develop motion design language reflecting brand personality
      - Add subtle, tasteful flourishes to key moments
      - Balance delight with usability and performance
  positive:
  - id: MICRO-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive interaction state coverage
    evidence_indicators:
    - All interactive elements have complete state definitions
    - Feedback is immediate and consistent
    - Design system documents all interaction patterns
  - id: MICRO-POS-002
    signal: Performance-optimized animations
    evidence_indicators:
    - Animations maintain 60fps across devices
    - GPU-accelerated properties used appropriately
    - Reduced motion alternatives implemented
  - id: MICRO-POS-003
    signal: Delightful signature interactions
    evidence_indicators:
