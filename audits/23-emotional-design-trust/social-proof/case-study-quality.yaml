  what: |
    Evaluates the quality, authenticity, and effectiveness of customer
    case studies and success stories. Assesses whether case studies
    include verifiable companies and results, tell compelling stories
    with specific details, represent diverse customer types, and are
    kept current. Reviews both content quality and presentation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Case studies are powerful trust-building tools for B2B sales, but
    weak case studies can undermine credibility. Generic case studies
    without verifiable companies or specific results feel manufactured.
    Strong case studies with named customers, concrete metrics, and
    genuine challenges/solutions significantly influence purchase
    decisions and reduce sales cycle length.

  - After new significant customer wins

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CASE-CRIT-001
    signal: Case study features non-existent company
    evidence_indicators:
    - Company cannot be found in any registry or online
    - Contact person doesn't exist on LinkedIn
    - Customer success team has no record of relationship
    explanation: |
      Fabricated case studies are fraud and destroy trust when
      discovered. This creates legal liability and severely damages
      brand credibility.
    remediation: |
      - Remove fabricated case studies immediately
      - Audit all case studies for authenticity
      - Implement verification before publication
  - id: CASE-CRIT-002
    signal: Case study claims are fabricated or significantly inflated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Results cannot be verified with customer
    - Claimed metrics far exceed what customer experienced
    - Customer disputes published claims
    explanation: |
      False claims in case studies are misleading and violate FTC
      advertising standards. Customers who dispute claims create
      significant reputational damage.
    remediation: |
      - Verify all claims with customers
      - Correct or remove disputed content
      - Require data verification before publication
  high:
  - id: CASE-HIGH-001
    signal: Case studies are all anonymized without necessity
    evidence_indicators:
    - No named companies in any case study
    - Generic descriptions like 'Fortune 500 company'
    - Anonymization used when customer would approve naming
    explanation: |
      Fully anonymized case studies feel untrustworthy - users can't
      verify anything. While some industries require anonymity, using
      it unnecessarily weakens social proof significantly.
    remediation: |
      - Request named approval from existing customers
      - Reserve anonymization for genuine necessity
      - Include as much verifiable detail as possible
  - id: CASE-HIGH-002
    signal: Case studies lack specific, quantified results
    evidence_indicators:
    - Vague claims like 'improved efficiency'
    - No metrics or percentages
    - Results could apply to any product
    explanation: |
      Generic results don't prove value. Specific metrics (50%
      reduction in X, $100K saved) are far more persuasive and
      credible than vague improvements.
    remediation: |
      - Work with customers to quantify outcomes
      - Include specific metrics and timeframes
      - Show before/after comparisons
  - id: CASE-HIGH-003
    signal: Case studies are significantly outdated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Case studies from 3+ years ago
    - Referenced product features no longer exist
    - Customer relationship has ended
    explanation: |
      Outdated case studies suggest inability to get recent wins
      and may reference irrelevant product versions or departed
      customers.
    remediation: |
      - Establish refresh cadence (annual review)"
      - Update or retire old case studies
      - Add new recent case studies regularly
  medium:
  - id: CASE-MED-001
    signal: Case studies don't represent customer diversity
    evidence_indicators:
    - All case studies from same industry
    - Only large/small companies represented
    - No geographic diversity if relevant
    remediation: |
      - Map target segments to case study coverage
      - Prioritize new case studies to fill gaps
      - Ensure prospects can find relevant examples
  - id: CASE-MED-002
    signal: Customer quotes feel generic or edited
    evidence_indicators:
    - Quotes feel corporate and sanitized
    - All quotes use similar language
    - No personality in customer voice
    remediation: |
      - Use genuine, unedited customer words
      - Include authentic voice even if imperfect
      - Consider video testimonials for authenticity
  - id: CASE-MED-003
    signal: Case study format is not scannable
    evidence_indicators:
    - Wall of text without structure
    - Key results buried in narrative
    - No executive summary or highlights
    remediation: |
      - Add callout boxes for key metrics
      - Structure with clear sections
      - Lead with results for scanners
  low:
  - id: CASE-LOW-001
    signal: No downloadable version available
