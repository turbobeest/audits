  what: |
    Evaluates the clarity and transparency of influencer relationships
    and partnership displays. Assesses whether partnership badges, "as
    featured in" sections, integration partner logos, and influencer
    endorsements are presented honestly, represent genuine relationships,
    and don't mislead users about the nature of the partnership.
  why_it_matters: |
    Partner logos and "as featured in" displays are powerful trust signals,
    but misleading presentations damage credibility. Displaying outdated
    partnerships, implying deeper relationships than exist, or using logos
    without permission creates legal risk and trust erosion. Clear, honest
    partnership communication builds sustainable credibility.
