  what: |
    Evaluates the integrity and fairness of customer review systems including
    collection, moderation, display, and manipulation prevention. Assesses
    whether reviews represent genuine customer experiences, whether negative
    reviews are suppressed, whether fake reviews are detected and removed,
    and whether the system complies with FTC regulations prohibiting review
    gating and suppression.
  why_it_matters: |
    The FTC's Consumer Review Rule (effective October 2024) prohibits review
    suppression, gating, and fake review creation, with penalties up to $51,744
    per violation. Beyond compliance, review system integrity directly impacts
    consumer trust - 4.5 million fake reviews were removed by TrustPilot in 2024
    alone. Companies like Fashion Nova have faced $4.2 million fines for
    suppressing negative reviews. Maintaining review integrity protects both
    legal standing and brand trust.
  when_to_run:
  - Annually as part of compliance audit
  - When implementing or changing review systems
  - After receiving complaints about review manipulation
  - Before major marketing campaigns using reviews
  - When FTC issues new guidance

signals:
  critical:
  - id: REVIEW-CRIT-001
    signal: Review gating - negative customers prevented from reviewing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Satisfaction survey before review invitation
    - Only satisfied customers sent to review page
    - Negative responders redirected to support instead of review
    explanation: |
      Review gating is explicitly prohibited by FTC Consumer Review Rule.
      Filtering customers based on likely review sentiment before they
      can review is deceptive and subject to $51,744 per violation fines.
    remediation: |
      - Remove any satisfaction pre-screening from review flow
      - Send review invitations to all customers equally
      - Consult legal about past gating practices
  - id: REVIEW-CRIT-002
    signal: Systematic suppression of negative reviews
    evidence_indicators:
    - Negative reviews disproportionately removed or rejected
    - Low-star reviews never published without clear policy reason
    - Moderation logs show pattern of removing negative feedback
    explanation: |
      Review suppression violates FTC rules and can result in major
      fines (Fashion Nova was fined $4.2M). Suppressing negative
      reviews creates misleading overall ratings.
    remediation: |
      - Audit moderation decisions for bias
      - Publish negative reviews that meet content guidelines
      - Document clear, content-based (not sentiment-based) removal criteria
      - Consult legal about past suppression
  - id: REVIEW-CRIT-003
    signal: Fake positive reviews created or purchased
    evidence_indicators:
    - Reviews from non-customers
    - Bulk reviews from similar sources
    - Paid review services used
    - Employee reviews without disclosure
    explanation: |
      Creating or purchasing fake reviews is prohibited by FTC rule
      and destroys trust when discovered. This includes employee
      reviews without disclosure and incentivized reviews without
      disclosure.
    remediation: |
      - Remove all fake or purchased reviews
      - Implement verified purchase system
      - Require disclosure for any incentivized reviews
      - Audit for undisclosed employee reviews
  high:
  - id: REVIEW-HIGH-001
    signal: No verified purchase indicators
    evidence_indicators:
    - Anyone can leave reviews without purchase verification
    - No 'Verified Purchase' badges shown
    - Reviews from non-customers mixed with customers
    explanation: |
      Without purchase verification, fake reviews can proliferate and
      legitimate reviews lose credibility. Users trust verified
      purchase reviews significantly more.
    remediation: |
      - Implement purchase verification for reviews
      - Display 'Verified Purchase' badges
      - Consider limiting reviews to verified customers
  - id: REVIEW-HIGH-002
    signal: No fake review detection or prevention
    evidence_indicators:
    - No automated detection systems
    - No manual review of suspicious patterns
    - Obvious fake reviews visible on site
    explanation: |
      Fake reviews damage trust and can implicate the business in
      deceptive practices if not actively prevented. TrustPilot
      removes 4.5M fake reviews annually through detection.
    remediation: |
      - Implement automated fake review detection
      - Establish manual review process for flagged reviews
      - Monitor for suspicious patterns (bulk submissions, similar language)
  - id: REVIEW-HIGH-003
    signal: Undisclosed incentivized reviews
    evidence_indicators:
    - Discounts or rewards offered for reviews
    - No disclosure shown on incentivized reviews
    - Contest entries for review submission
    explanation: |
      FTC requires disclosure of material connections including
      incentives. Undisclosed incentivized reviews are deceptive.
    remediation: |
      - Add disclosure to all incentivized reviews
      - Establish incentive disclosure policy
      - Consider removing incentives for cleaner compliance
  medium:

      - Publish review policy on site
      - Explain moderation criteria transparently

    signal: Default sorting hides negative reviews
    evidence_indicators:
    - Default sort shows most positive first
    - Users must actively seek negative reviews
