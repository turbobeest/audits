description:
  what: |
    Evaluates the accuracy, transparency, and credibility of user counts,
    customer statistics, and numerical social proof claims displayed on
    the website. Assesses whether claims like "10,000+ customers" or
    "1M users" are accurate, verifiable, clearly defined (what counts
    as a "user"?), appropriately dated, and not misleading.
  why_it_matters: |
    Numerical social proof powerfully influences user decisions, but
    inflated or misleading statistics damage trust when discovered.
    Vague or outdated numbers raise suspicion about legitimacy. FTC
    regulations require that advertising claims, including statistics,
    be truthful and substantiated. Accurate, well-defined metrics
    build credibility while exaggerated claims create liability.
  when_to_run:
  - Before publishing new statistics on website
  - Quarterly to verify statistics remain accurate
  - During marketing campaign launches
  - After significant user growth or churn
  - When competitors challenge claims

signals:
  critical:
  - id: STATS-CRIT-001
    signal: Statistics are fabricated or significantly inflated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Displayed numbers far exceed actual data
    - Claims cannot be substantiated with any methodology
    - Numbers are complete fabrications
    explanation: |
      Fabricated statistics are false advertising and violate FTC
      regulations. They create legal liability and destroy trust
      when exposed. This includes inflating numbers by 2x or more.
    remediation: |
      - Correct all statistics to accurate numbers immediately
      - Document methodology for all claims
      - Consider legal review of past claims
      - Implement verification process before publishing
  - id: STATS-CRIT-002
    signal: Misleading definitions hide true meaning
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users counts include bots or test accounts
    - Customers includes free trial signups who never paid
    - Statistics measure something different than implied
    explanation: |
      Using misleading definitions to inflate numbers is deceptive.
      Claiming "1M users" when counting anyone who ever visited is
      fundamentally dishonest.
    remediation: |
      - Use honest definitions that match user expectations
      - Clarify what's being counted
      - Remove statistics that can't be honestly represented
  high:
  - id: STATS-HIGH-001
    signal: Statistics are outdated and no longer accurate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same numbers displayed for years
    - Current metrics significantly differ from displayed
    - No indication of when statistics were measured
    explanation: |
      Outdated statistics misrepresent current state, especially
      if growth has slowed or numbers have decreased. Users expect
      statistics to reflect current reality.
    remediation: |
      - Update statistics to current accurate numbers
      - Add date context ("As of January 2025")
      - Establish regular refresh cadence
  - id: STATS-HIGH-002
    signal: No substantiation for displayed claims
    evidence_indicators:
    - Statistics displayed but source unknown
    - No internal data to verify claims
    - Marketing made up numbers without checking
    explanation: |
      FTC requires that advertising claims be substantiated. Unable
      to verify claims creates legal risk and suggests they may be
      fabricated.
    remediation: |
      - Identify source for every displayed statistic
      - Remove any unverifiable claims
      - Document methodology for future claims
  medium:
  - id: STATS-MED-001
    signal: Statistics lack context or definition
    evidence_indicators:
    - 10,000+ users but no definition of user
    - No time period specified
    - Ambiguous what's being counted
    remediation: |
      - Add clear definitions (active users, paying customers, etc.)
      - Specify time periods where relevant
      - Provide context for meaningful interpretation
  - id: STATS-MED-002
    signal: Statistics shown as exact when estimates
    evidence_indicators:
    - Exactly 10,000 users (suspiciously round)
    - Precise numbers that are actually estimates
    - False precision in displayed numbers
    remediation: |
      - Use ranges or approximations honestly
      - Show actual numbers rather than rounded estimates
      - Be transparent about precision
  - id: STATS-MED-003
    signal: Inconsistent statistics across channels
    evidence_indicators:
    - Website says 10K users, pitch deck says 15K
    - Different definitions used in different places
    - Statistics not updated consistently
    remediation: |
      - Establish single source of truth for statistics
      - Audit all channels for consistency
      - Update all channels simultaneously
  low:
  - id: STATS-LOW-001
    signal: Statistics not prominently displayed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Compelling statistics buried or hidden
    - Social proof not leveraged effectively
    remediation: |
      - Consider strategic placement of verified statistics
      - Display compelling numbers in hero sections
  positive:
  - id: STATS-POS-001
    signal: Accurate, well-documented statistics
    evidence_indicators:
    - Numbers verified against internal data
    - Clear definitions provided
    - Regular refresh process in place
  - id: STATS-POS-002
    signal: Transparent methodology
