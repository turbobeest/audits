  what: |
    Evaluates the authenticity, verifiability, and credibility of customer
    testimonials displayed throughout the digital experience. Assesses
    whether testimonials represent real customers with genuine experiences,
    include verifiable attribution (name, photo, company, role), and avoid
    patterns associated with fake or manufactured social proof. Reviews
    compliance with FTC testimonial guidelines.
  why_it_matters: |
    Studies estimate up to 30% of online reviews could be fake, and consumers
    are increasingly skeptical. Fake testimonials destroy trust when discovered
    and violate FTC regulations, potentially resulting in fines up to $51,744
    per violation. Authentic, verified testimonials build genuine trust and
    convert better than generic or suspicious-looking social proof.

    evidence_indicators:
    - Photos are stock images (reverse image search confirms)
    - Named person has no online presence
    - Company does not exist in registries
    - No documentation of customer relationship
    explanation: |
      Fabricated testimonials are fraud and violate FTC regulations.
      Penalties can reach $51,744 per violation. Discovery of fake
      testimonials destroys all trust.
    remediation: |
      - Remove all fabricated testimonials immediately
      - Audit all testimonials for authenticity
      - Implement verification process for future testimonials
      - Consult legal counsel about past violations
  - id: TESTIM-CRIT-002
    signal: Paid testimonials without disclosure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Customers compensated for testimonials
    - No disclosure of material connection
    - Incentives offered for positive reviews
    explanation: |
      FTC requires disclosure of material connections including
      payment, free products, or other compensation. Failure to
      disclose is deceptive and violates regulations.
    remediation: |
      - Add clear disclosure to compensated testimonials
      - Review all testimonials for undisclosed compensation
      - Establish disclosure policy for future testimonials

    evidence_indicators:
    - First name only with no last name
    - No company or role provided
    - Generic initials (J.S., Customer)
    - No way to verify the person exists
    explanation: |
      Unverifiable testimonials appear suspicious to savvy consumers.
      They provide no way to confirm authenticity and may be perceived
      as fabricated even if genuine.
    remediation: |
      - Request full attribution from testimonial sources
      - Include company, role, and ideally LinkedIn
      - Consider "Verified Customer" badges

    - Time frames or metrics inflated
    - Customer disputes the testimonial content
    explanation: |
      Inaccurate testimonials are misleading and may violate FTC
      guidelines on truthfulness. Customers who see their words
      changed may complain publicly.
    remediation: |
      - Verify testimonial accuracy with original source
      - Use exact customer words without editing for impact
      - Document approval for any edits
      - Remove disputed testimonials

    explanation: |

      are from real customers.
    remediation: |
      - Remove stock photos immediately
      - Request actual customer photos
      - If photos unavailable, use no photo rather than fake
