  what: |
    Evaluates compliance with FTC endorsement guidelines by assessing
    whether material connections between endorsers and the company are
    properly disclosed. Reviews testimonials, influencer content, employee
    reviews, affiliate relationships, paid partnerships, and any content
    where the endorser received compensation, free products, or has a
    business relationship.
  why_it_matters: |
    FTC endorsement guidelines require clear disclosure of material
    connections that might affect the weight a consumer gives to an
    endorsement. Failure to disclose can result in FTC enforcement
    actions with penalties up to $51,744 per violation. Beyond legal
    risk, undisclosed paid endorsements destroy consumer trust when
    exposed - users feel deceived and betrayed.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching influencer campaigns
  - During compliance reviews
  - When adding testimonials with any compensation
  - After FTC guidance updates
  - When employee social media policies change

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DISCL-CRIT-001
    signal: Paid endorsements with no disclosure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Influencer received payment but no disclosure visible
    - Paid testimonial appears organic
    - Sponsored content not marked as such
    explanation: |
      Undisclosed paid endorsements violate FTC guidelines and can
      result in enforcement actions against both the brand and
      endorser. Penalties can reach $51,744 per violation.
    remediation: |
      - Add clear disclosures to all paid content
      - Require disclosure in influencer agreements
      - Audit existing content for missing disclosures
  - id: DISCL-CRIT-002
    signal: Employee reviews without disclosure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Employees posted reviews on third-party sites
    - No employment relationship disclosed
    - Appears to be organic customer review
    explanation: |
      Employee reviews without disclosure are deceptive. The
      employment relationship is a material connection that
      must be disclosed.
    remediation: |
      - Remove undisclosed employee reviews or add disclosure
      - Implement employee social media policy
      - Train employees on disclosure requirements
  - id: DISCL-CRIT-003
    signal: Affiliate links without disclosure
    evidence_indicators:
    - Affiliate links earning commission
    - No disclosure that poster earns from purchases
    - Appears as organic recommendation
    explanation: |
      Affiliate relationships where the endorser earns commission
      must be disclosed. This applies to website content, social
      media, and email.
    remediation: |
      - Add affiliate disclosure near all affiliate links
      - Make disclosure visible before users click
      - Use clear language about earning potential
  high:
  - id: DISCL-HIGH-001
    signal: Disclosure present but not clear and prominent
    evidence_indicators:
    - Disclosure buried in hashtags
    - Disclosure only visible if 'more' clicked
    - Disclosure at end of long post
    - Small or hard-to-read disclosure
    explanation: |
      FTC requires disclosures be clear and conspicuous. Hidden
      or easily-missed disclosures don't satisfy requirements.
      Must be visible before consumer acts on endorsement.
    remediation: |
      - Move disclosure to beginning/prominent position
      - Use clear language (not just #ad buried in hashtags)
      - Ensure disclosure visible without additional clicks
  - id: DISCL-HIGH-002
    signal: Free products given without disclosure requirement
    evidence_indicators:
    - Products sent to influencers/reviewers
    - No disclosure in resulting content
    - No disclosure requirement in agreement
    explanation: |
      Free products are material connections requiring disclosure.
      Even if not paid, receiving free product must be disclosed
      as it may affect the endorsement.
    remediation: |
      - Require disclosure in all free product agreements
      - Follow up to verify disclosure in content
      - Add disclosure to any testimonials from recipients
  - id: DISCL-HIGH-003
    signal: Disclosure language is unclear or jargon
    evidence_indicators:
    - Uses insider terms (sp, spon, collab)
    - Ambiguous whether it's an ad
    - Platform-specific features used incorrectly
    explanation: |
      Disclosure must be understandable to ordinary consumers.
      Abbreviations and jargon may not be clear to all audiences.
    remediation: |
      - Use plain language (Ad, Paid partnership, Sponsored)
      - Avoid abbreviations that may confuse
      - Be explicit about the relationship
