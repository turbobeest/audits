  what: |
    Evaluates how the application attributes responsibility when things go
    wrong. Examines whether error messages, failure states, and support
    interactions inappropriately blame users, external services, or shift
    responsibility in ways that damage trust. Assesses language patterns
    that imply user fault versus taking ownership for system issues.
  why_it_matters: |
    Blame attribution psychology shows:
    - Users blamed for system issues are 2.5x more likely to churn
    - Self-blame reduces user self-efficacy and engagement
    - External blame (third-party) reduces trust in the platform
    - Taking ownership increases perceived reliability even after failures

    Products should protect user self-esteem, take appropriate ownership
    of platform issues, and frame external factors without deflection.
  when_to_run:
  - During error message content audit
  - When user feedback mentions feeling blamed
  - After support interaction reviews
  - During UX writing standards development
  - Before production launch

    - How do you handle errors caused by external services?
    purpose: Understand content approach to blame
    duration: 20 min
  - role: Customer Support Lead
    questions:
    - What errors do users feel blamed by?
    - How do you frame responsibility in responses?
    - What user complaints relate to feeling blamed?
    purpose: Identify problematic blame patterns
    duration: 20 min
  documents_to_review:
  - type: Error message guidelines
    purpose: Check for blame-avoidance guidance
    look_for:
    - Language framing recommendations
    - User vs system attribution guidance
    - External service failure handling

  - pattern: you\s+(entered|provided|selected|chose|did)
    type: regex

  - pattern: invalid|wrong|incorrect|bad|failed
    type: regex
    scope: strings
    purpose: Find judgmental error language
  blame_pattern_checklist:
  - pattern: Direct user blame
    examples:
    - You entered an invalid email
    - You chose the wrong option
    - Your input caused an error
    better_alternatives:
    - Please enter a valid email format
    - This option isn't available for your account
    - We couldn't process this input
  - pattern: Passive-aggressive blame
    examples:
    - As you may recall, you agreed to...
    - If you had read the instructions...
    - Unlike other users who...
    better_alternatives: Remove comparison and assumption
  - pattern: External deflection
    examples:
    - Our payment provider failed
    - The API returned an error
    - Third-party service is down
    better_alternatives:
    - We're having trouble processing payments
    - This feature is temporarily unavailable
    - We're working to restore this service
  - pattern: Ambiguous blame
    examples:
    - Something went wrong
    - An error occurred
    - Request failed
    better_alternatives:
    - We couldn't complete this action
    - This didn't work as expected
    - Let's try that again

    purpose: Rate messages for blame patterns
signals:
  critical:
  - id: BLAME-CRIT-001
    signal: Error messages directly blame users
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''You entered invalid data'' patterns'
    - '''Your mistake caused'' language'
    - Messages that say user 'failed'
    - User feedback about feeling blamed
    explanation: |
      Direct blame damages user self-efficacy and trust. Even when
      users did make errors, framing matters for emotional response
      and willingness to continue.
    remediation: |
      - Reframe to focus on situation not person
      - Use passive voice for user errors
      - "Invalid email" -> "Please check email format"
      - "You failed to" -> "Let's try again with..."
  - id: BLAME-CRIT-002
    signal: Condescending or patronizing language
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''As we explained earlier...'' patterns'
    - '''Obviously you need to...'' language'
    - Messages implying user is stupid
    - Assuming user didn't read instructions
    explanation: |
      Condescending language attacks user intelligence and creates
      hostility. This is especially damaging when users are already
      frustrated by errors.
    remediation: |
      - Remove assumptions about user knowledge
      - Never reference previous instructions accusingly
      - Treat every error as a fresh opportunity to help
      - Assume good intent from users
  high:
  - id: BLAME-HIGH-001
    signal: System errors deflect to third parties
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Our provider failed'' without ownership'
    - Explicit naming of vendor failures
    - Blaming API or external services
    - No acknowledgment of platform responsibility
    explanation: |
      While external dependencies do fail, deflecting blame to them
      undermines user trust in the platform. Users chose your product,
      not your dependencies - own the experience.
    remediation: |
      - Take ownership of failures, mention cause if helpful
      - "We're experiencing issues" not "Stripe is down"
      - Show you're working to resolve regardless of cause
      - Don't expose vendor internals to users
  - id: BLAME-HIGH-002
    signal: Passive voice obscures system responsibility
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''An error occurred'' without ownership'
    - '''Your request could not be processed'' patterns'
    - Vague language avoiding responsibility
    explanation: |
      Passive voice that avoids saying "we" can feel evasive.
      When the system fails, owning it with "we" is more trustworthy
      than passive construction.
    remediation: |
      - Use "we" for system errors: "We couldn't process..."
      - Active voice for system responsibility
      - Reserve passive for user errors to avoid blame
  - id: BLAME-HIGH-003
    signal: Different blame standards for different contexts
    evidence_indicators:
    - User errors blamed, system errors vague
    - Inconsistent ownership patterns
    - Some areas blame users, others don't
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent blame attribution creates confusion about
      product voice and feels arbitrary. Consistency in framing
      responsibility builds trust.
    remediation: |
      - Establish consistent blame attribution guidelines
      - Apply same standards across all error types
      - Review all errors for consistency
  medium:
  - id: BLAME-MED-001
    signal: Validation errors use judgmental language
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Invalid'', ''wrong'', ''bad'' for user input'
    - Negative framing of validation failures
    - Judgment words in validation messages
    remediation: |
      - Reframe validation as guidance not judgment
      - "Invalid email" -> "Please enter email as name@example.com"
      - Focus on what's needed, not what's wrong
  - id: BLAME-MED-002
    signal: Error messages don't protect user self-esteem
    evidence_indicators:
    - No reassurance that errors are common
    - No framing that task is difficult
    - Errors feel like personal failure
    remediation: |
      - Add contextual reassurance where appropriate
      - "This is a common mistake" where true
      - Frame complex tasks as legitimately challenging
  low:
  - id: BLAME-LOW-001
    signal: No guidelines for blame attribution
    evidence_indicators:
    - Ad-hoc blame framing decisions
    - No documented standards
    - Inconsistency suggests no policy
    remediation: |
      - Document blame attribution guidelines
      - Include in error message style guide
      - Review errors against guidelines
  positive:
  - id: BLAME-POS-001
    signal: User-protective error framing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Errors focus on situation, not person
    - Validation guides without judging
    - User self-esteem protected
  - id: BLAME-POS-002
    signal: System ownership of platform issues
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''We'' used for system errors'
    - Ownership taken regardless of cause
    - External factors mentioned without deflection
  - id: BLAME-POS-003
    signal: Consistent attribution across product
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same framing standards everywhere
    - Guidelines followed consistently
    - No arbitrary blame variations
