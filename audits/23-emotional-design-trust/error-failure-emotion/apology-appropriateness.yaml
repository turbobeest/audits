  what: |
    Evaluates when and how the application apologizes to users for failures,
    inconveniences, and service disruptions. Assesses whether apologies are
    appropriately deployed (not over-apologizing for minor issues or under-
    apologizing for significant failures), sincere in tone, accompanied by
    remediation, and culturally appropriate. Examines error messages, status
    pages, incident communications, and recovery flows for apology quality.
  why_it_matters: |
    Apology psychology research shows:
    - Appropriate apology increases forgiveness by 40%
    - Empty apologies without action decrease trust
    - Over-apologizing undermines confidence in the product
    - Under-apologizing for serious issues escalates anger
    - Cultural context affects apology expectations

    The right apology at the right time can strengthen relationships;
    the wrong apology (or absence of one) can permanently damage trust.
  when_to_run:
  - During error messaging review
  - After major incidents to assess communication
  - When user feedback mentions feeling dismissed
  - Before international expansion (cultural review)
  - During brand voice refinement

  - tool: Apology appropriateness scorecard
    purpose: Evaluate apologies against criteria
signals:
  critical:
  - id: APOLOGY-CRIT-001
    signal: No apology for serious user-impacting failures
    evidence_indicators:
    - Data loss communicated without apology
    - Major outage messages focus only on status
    - Significant errors have no acknowledgment
    - User impact minimized or ignored
    explanation: |
      When the product fails users significantly, failure to apologize
      signals indifference. Users expect acknowledgment proportional
      to impact - serious failures require sincere apologies.
    remediation: |
      - Add appropriate apology to serious error messages
      - Create incident communication templates with apology
      - Train team on proportional acknowledgment
      - Review communications for empathy before sending
  - id: APOLOGY-CRIT-002
    signal: Defensive posture in failure communication
    evidence_indicators:
    - Errors blame external factors immediately
    - Apologies qualified with excuses
    - Focus on why it's not the product's fault
    - User feedback mentions feeling dismissed
    explanation: |
      Defensive communication shifts blame rather than accepting
      responsibility. Even when external factors contribute, leading
      with defense rather than empathy damages trust.
    remediation: |
      - Lead with acknowledgment, follow with explanation
      - Take responsibility before citing factors
      - Focus on user impact, not technical causes
      - Train team on empathy-first communication
  high:
  - id: APOLOGY-HIGH-001
    signal: Over-apologizing for minor issues
    evidence_indicators:
    - Profuse apology for small inconveniences
    - '''We''re so sorry'' for transient errors'
    - Excessive apology language throughout
    - Apology fatigue - users stop noticing
    explanation: |
      Over-apologizing devalues apologies and can undermine confidence.
      If everything warrants deep apology, serious issues don't stand out.
      It can also signal insecurity about product quality.
    remediation: |
      - Reserve full apologies for significant issues
      - Use brief acknowledgment for minor issues
      - Scale apology language to impact
      - Avoid "sorry" when simple acknowledgment suffices
  - id: APOLOGY-HIGH-002
    signal: Apologies not accompanied by action
    evidence_indicators:
    - Sorry message without next steps
    - Apology without remediation commitment
    - Acknowledgment but no path forward
    - Empty words without substance
    explanation: |
      Apologies without action ring hollow. Research shows apologies
      must include remediation commitment to be effective. "Sorry"
      alone is insufficient.
    remediation: |
      - Pair apologies with actionable next steps
      - Commit to remediation where applicable
      - Provide alternative paths after failures
      - Follow up on committed actions
  - id: APOLOGY-HIGH-003
    signal: Apology timing inappropriate
    evidence_indicators:
    - Delayed apology for known issues
    - Apology only after user complaint
    - No proactive communication during incidents
    - Apology comes too late to matter
    explanation: |
      Apology timing affects effectiveness. Early acknowledgment
      prevents anger escalation; late apologies feel reactive and
      insincere.
    remediation: |
      - Issue apologies promptly when issues occur
      - Communicate proactively during incidents
      - Don't wait for complaints to acknowledge
      - Update status before users ask
  medium:
  - id: APOLOGY-MED-001
    signal: Apology tone inconsistent with brand
    evidence_indicators:
    - Apologies feel corporate in casual product
    - Too casual for serious failures
    - Tone doesn't match rest of product voice
    remediation: |
      - Align apology tone with brand voice
      - Create apology templates in brand style
      - Balance personality with appropriate seriousness
  - id: APOLOGY-MED-002
    signal: Apology language repetitive or template
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same apology text everywhere
    - Clearly templated without personalization
    - Generic 'sorry for inconvenience'
    remediation: |
      - Personalize apologies where possible
      - Acknowledge specific issue in apology
      - Vary language while maintaining tone
  - id: APOLOGY-MED-003
    signal: Apologizing for user errors
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Sorry, that email is invalid'''
    - Apologizing when user made mistake
    - Taking blame for user actions
    remediation: |
      - Don't apologize for user errors
      - Be helpful without false apology
      - Guide correction without self-blame
