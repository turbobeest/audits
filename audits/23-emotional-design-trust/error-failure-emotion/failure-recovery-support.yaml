  what: |
    Evaluates how well the application supports users in recovering from
    failures and errors. Examines retry mechanisms, undo functionality,
    auto-save behavior, data preservation during errors, alternative paths,
    escalation options, and overall resilience of user workflows. Assesses
    whether users can recover gracefully or are left stranded after failures.
  why_it_matters: |
    Recovery support determines whether failures are minor setbacks or major
    frustrations:
    - Users who can easily recover from errors are 3x more likely to continue
    - Data loss during errors is the #1 driver of app uninstalls
    - Easy undo reduces user anxiety and encourages exploration
    - Retry functionality reduces support burden by 40%

    Good recovery design assumes failures will happen and prepares users
    to recover with minimal friction and emotional impact.
  when_to_run:
  - During resilience and error handling review
  - When user feedback mentions lost work
  - After implementing retry/undo functionality
  - Before production launch
  - When support tickets cite unrecoverable states

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RECOVERY-CRIT-001
    signal: User work lost on error without warning
    evidence_indicators:
    - Form data cleared after submission failure
    - Document content lost on save error
    - No auto-save for long-form content
    - Network error destroys unsaved work
    explanation: |
      Losing user work is one of the most frustrating experiences
      possible. It destroys trust, increases abandonment, and
      generates significant negative sentiment.
    remediation: |
      - Implement auto-save for all content creation
      - Preserve form data across submission failures
      - Store work locally before attempting server save
      - Enable draft recovery after failures
  - id: RECOVERY-CRIT-002
    signal: No undo for destructive actions
    evidence_indicators:
    - Deleted items immediately and permanently removed
    - No undo option after destructive operations
    - No confirmation for high-impact actions
    - Users report accidental permanent deletion
    explanation: |
      Without undo, users must be extremely careful, increasing
      cognitive load and anxiety. Accidental destructive actions
      with no recovery cause significant user distress.
    remediation: |
      - Implement undo for all destructive actions
      - Use soft delete with recovery period
      - Show confirmation with undo option after deletion
      - Add trash/archive as intermediate state
  - id: RECOVERY-CRIT-003
    signal: No retry mechanism for failed operations
    evidence_indicators:
    - Failed operations require full restart
    - No retry button on error states
    - User must navigate away and back to retry
    - Network errors provide no retry option
    explanation: |
      Without easy retry, transient failures become permanent
      blockers. Users may give up rather than navigate back
      and try again.
    remediation: |
      - Add retry button to all failure states
      - Implement automatic retry for network errors
      - Preserve context for easy retry
      - Show retry count and timing for auto-retry
  high:
  - id: RECOVERY-HIGH-001
    signal: Session timeout loses user work
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unsaved work lost when session expires
    - No warning before timeout
    - Re-authentication doesn't restore state
    - Long forms lost to timeout
    explanation: |
      Session timeouts should be transparent to user work.
      Losing progress to authentication requirements
      suggests poor session handling.
    remediation: |
      - Auto-save work before session timeout
      - Warn users before timeout with extend option
      - Restore state after re-authentication
      - Maintain draft locally independent of session
  - id: RECOVERY-HIGH-002
    signal: Failed partial operations leave inconsistent state
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multi-step operation fails mid-way leaving partial data
    - User sees inconsistent state after failure
    - No rollback for failed multi-step processes
    - Manual cleanup required after failures
    explanation: |
      Partial failures that leave inconsistent state create
      confusion and require manual intervention to resolve.
    remediation: |
      - Implement transactional operations where possible
      - Rollback partial changes on failure
      - Communicate clearly what succeeded vs failed
      - Provide path to complete or clean up
  - id: RECOVERY-HIGH-003
    signal: Optimistic UI doesn't handle failure gracefully
    evidence_indicators:
    - Action appears to succeed then fails silently
    - UI shows success before server confirmation
    - Failure reversal is jarring or missing
    - User doesn't realize action failed
    explanation: |
      Optimistic UI improves perceived performance but requires
      careful failure handling. Users must clearly understand
      when optimistic updates fail.
    remediation: |
      - Clearly communicate when optimistic action fails
      - Provide obvious way to retry
      - Don't silently swallow failures
      - Consider queuing failed actions for retry
  medium:
  - id: RECOVERY-MED-001
    signal: No conflict resolution for concurrent edits
    evidence_indicators:
    - Last write wins without warning
    - No indication others are editing
    - Conflicts silently overwrite
    - Collaborative scenarios problematic
    remediation: |
      - Implement conflict detection
      - Show when others are editing
      - Provide merge or resolution UI
      - Preserve both versions if conflict
  - id: RECOVERY-MED-002
    signal: Recovery paths unclear or hidden
    evidence_indicators:
    - Undo exists but not discoverable
    - Trash location unknown
    - Recovery process not documented
    - Users don't know recovery is possible
    remediation: |
      - Show undo prominently after actions
      - Make trash/archive easily findable
      - Document recovery options
      - Communicate recovery availability
  - id: RECOVERY-MED-003
    signal: No version history for important content
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only current version saved
    - Previous versions unrecoverable
    - Accidental changes can't be reviewed
    remediation: |
      - Implement version history for documents
      - Allow viewing and restoring previous versions
      - Auto-save version snapshots
  low:
  - id: RECOVERY-LOW-001
    signal: Recovery grace period too short
    evidence_indicators:
    - Undo window expires quickly
    - Trash items deleted too soon
    - Recovery opportunity easily missed
    remediation: |
      - Extend undo windows to reasonable duration
      - Keep deleted items for 30+ days
      - Allow extending recovery windows
  positive:
  - id: RECOVERY-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive auto-save implemented
    evidence_indicators:
    - Work saved automatically during editing
    - No data loss on errors or closures
    - Drafts recoverable after failures
  - id: RECOVERY-POS-002
    signal: Universal undo functionality
    evidence_indicators:
    - All destructive actions undoable
    - Undo prominently available
    - Reasonable grace period
  - id: RECOVERY-POS-003
    signal: Resilient network handling
    evidence_indicators:
