  what: |
    Evaluates how the organization communicates compensation, credits, refunds,
    or remediation when failures significantly impact users. Assesses whether
    compensation is offered proactively or only on request, how clearly it's
    communicated, whether the amount/type is proportional to impact, and
    whether the process creates goodwill or further frustration.
  why_it_matters: |
    Compensation communication affects post-failure relationship:
    - Proactive compensation increases loyalty by 50% post-incident
    - Compensation offered only after complaints feels grudging
    - Unclear compensation creates additional support burden
    - Proportional compensation validates user's experience

    Well-handled compensation can turn negative experiences into
    loyalty-building moments; poorly handled compensation compounds
    the original failure.
  when_to_run:
  - After major service disruptions
  - When reviewing SLA and compensation policies
  - Before launching new compensation program
  - When support tickets cite compensation confusion
  - During customer experience improvement initiatives

    purpose: Evaluate communications against criteria
signals:
  critical:
  - id: COMP-CRIT-001
    signal: Compensation only provided on explicit request
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users must ask for refunds/credits
    - No proactive compensation offers
    - Compensation feels extracted rather than offered
    - Support process required to get compensation
    explanation: |
      Requiring users to request compensation they're entitled to
      feels adversarial. It creates additional burden for already-
      frustrated users and signals reluctance to make things right.
    remediation: |
      - Offer compensation proactively after significant failures
      - Auto-apply credits where possible
      - Communicate compensation before users have to ask
      - Make compensation process frictionless
  - id: COMP-CRIT-002
    signal: Compensation amount not proportional to impact
    evidence_indicators:
    - Token compensation for major failures
    - One-size-fits-all compensation regardless of impact
    - Users feel compensation dismisses their experience
    - Compensation perceived as insulting
    explanation: |
      Compensation that feels inadequate can anger users more than
      no compensation. It signals the organization doesn't understand
      or value the user's experience.
    remediation: |
      - Scale compensation to actual user impact
      - Consider business impact for B2B customers
      - Offer additional goodwill beyond minimum
      - Validate that compensation feels meaningful
  high:
  - id: COMP-HIGH-001
    signal: Compensation process unclear or difficult
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users don't know how to get compensation
    - Multiple steps required to receive credit
    - Compensation requires support ticket
    - Process creates additional frustration
    explanation: |
      Difficult compensation processes compound the original failure.
      Users already frustrated shouldn't face bureaucracy to get
      remediation they're owed.
    remediation: |
      - Simplify compensation process
      - Auto-apply where possible
      - One-click acceptance for manual
      - Clear communication of process
  - id: COMP-HIGH-002
    signal: Compensation communicated poorly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Compensation buried in long email
    - Unclear what compensation is being offered
    - Terms and conditions obscure the offer
    - Users don't realize they're receiving compensation
    explanation: |
      Compensation that users don't notice or understand provides
      no goodwill benefit. Communication must be clear and prominent.
    remediation: |
      - Lead communications with compensation offer
      - Use clear, simple language
      - Highlight key details (amount, how to receive)
      - Confirm receipt/application
  - id: COMP-HIGH-003
    signal: Compensation delayed significantly
    evidence_indicators:
    - Weeks between incident and compensation
    - Users have to follow up
    - Compensation arrives long after incident resolved
    explanation: |
      Delayed compensation loses impact. By the time it arrives,
      users may have already churned or lost trust.
    remediation: |
      - Issue compensation promptly after incidents
      - Set SLAs for compensation timing
      - Communicate expected timing if delay needed
      - Prioritize compensation in incident resolution
  medium:
  - id: COMP-MED-001
    signal: Compensation type not valuable to user
    evidence_indicators:
    - Credit for service user is canceling
    - Discount on features user doesn't use
    - Compensation form doesn't match user needs
    remediation: |
      - Offer choice of compensation types
      - Ensure compensation has actual value
      - Consider cash/credit alternatives
      - Match compensation to user context
  - id: COMP-MED-002
    signal: Compensation communication not personalized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Generic compensation message
    - No acknowledgment of specific impact
    - Template feels impersonal
    remediation: |
      - Personalize compensation communications
      - Reference specific impact where known
      - Add human touch to significant cases
  - id: COMP-MED-003
    signal: No follow-up after compensation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Compensation sent with no confirmation
    - No check on whether issue resolved
    - Relationship not restored
    remediation: |
      - Confirm compensation received/applied
      - Follow up on user satisfaction
      - Ensure relationship restored
  low:
  - id: COMP-LOW-001
    signal: Compensation policy not documented publicly
    evidence_indicators:
