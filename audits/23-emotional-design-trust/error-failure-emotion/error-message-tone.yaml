  what: |
    Evaluates the emotional quality, clarity, and helpfulness of error messages
    throughout the application. Examines validation errors, system errors,
    permission errors, and failure states for appropriate tone, user blame
    avoidance, actionable guidance, and emotional support during frustrating
    moments. Assesses whether error messages maintain trust while helping
    users recover.
  why_it_matters: |
    Error messages are critical emotional touchpoints:
    - 65% of users say error messages impact their perception of a brand
    - Poor error messages increase support tickets by 40%
    - Accusatory error language causes 30% higher abandonment
    - Well-crafted errors can turn negative moments into trust-builders

    Errors are inevitable - how they're communicated determines whether
    users feel supported or blamed, whether they can recover or abandon,
    and whether trust is maintained or destroyed.
  when_to_run:
  - During UX writing and content review
  - When support tickets cite confusing errors
  - After major error handling refactoring
  - Before production launch
  - When localization reveals tone issues

    purpose: Evaluate each error against tone criteria
signals:
  critical:
  - id: ERRTONE-CRIT-001
    signal: Error messages blame the user
    evidence_indicators:
    - Messages use 'you' in accusatory way ('You entered...')
    - Phrases like 'Invalid input' without context
    - Messages imply user is at fault for system issues
    - User feedback mentions feeling blamed or stupid
    explanation: |
      Accusatory errors damage trust and self-efficacy. Users who feel
      blamed are more likely to abandon than retry. Even when users
      did make mistakes, framing matters.
    remediation: |
      - Reframe errors to focus on the situation, not the user
      - Use passive voice or system-focused language
      - "Email address isn't valid" -> "Please enter a valid email format"
      - "You don't have permission" -> "This action requires admin access"
  - id: ERRTONE-CRIT-002
    signal: Errors provide no guidance for recovery
    evidence_indicators:
    - Error just states problem without solution
    - '''Something went wrong'' with no next steps'
    - No way forward from error state
    - Users must guess how to fix
    explanation: |
      Errors without recovery guidance leave users stuck. Every error
      should include what to do next, even if it's "try again later"
      or "contact support."
    remediation: |
      - Add actionable guidance to every error
      - Include specific steps to resolve if known
      - Provide alternative paths when main action fails
      - Include retry, go back, or contact support options
  - id: ERRTONE-CRIT-003
    signal: Technical jargon exposed to end users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Error codes without human explanation (Error 5xx)
    - Technical terms users won't understand
    - Stack traces or developer messages shown
    - Database or API errors passed through
    explanation: |
      Technical errors confuse users and signal poor quality. Users
      can't act on information they don't understand, and technical
      exposure suggests the product is unfinished.
    remediation: |
      - Create user-friendly messages for all error types
      - Map technical errors to human explanations
      - Never expose raw stack traces or system errors
      - Include error codes only for support reference
  high:
  - id: ERRTONE-HIGH-001
    signal: Inconsistent error tone across product
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some errors friendly, others cold
    - Different teams wrote errors in different styles
    - No error content guidelines
    - Tone shifts between product areas
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent error tone creates confusion about brand personality
      and suggests multiple authors/quality levels in the product.
    remediation: |
      - Create error message style guide
      - Audit and rewrite errors for consistency
      - Establish review process for new errors
      - Centralize error content management
  - id: ERRTONE-HIGH-002
    signal: Validation errors not inline/contextual
    evidence_indicators:
    - All errors shown in single alert at top
    - Error message doesn't indicate which field
    - User must search for problem
    - Form resets on error, losing input
    explanation: |
      Errors far from the problem source require users to hunt for
      issues. This increases frustration and recovery time.
    remediation: |
      - Show validation errors inline next to fields
      - Highlight problematic fields visually
      - Preserve user input on error
      - List errors with field links if using summary
  - id: ERRTONE-HIGH-003
    signal: Error messages are vague
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Invalid value'' without specifying why'
    - '''Error occurred'' without detail'
    - '''Please try again'' without context'
    - User can't understand what went wrong
    explanation: |
      Vague errors don't help users understand or fix problems.
      Specificity enables recovery; vagueness creates frustration.
    remediation: |
      - Be specific about what's wrong
      - Explain validation requirements clearly
      - Include expected format examples where helpful
      - Tell users exactly what to change
  medium:
  - id: ERRTONE-MED-001
    signal: System errors not apologetic
    evidence_indicators:
    - System failure messages don't acknowledge impact
    - No empathy for user frustration
    - Matter-of-fact tone for user-impacting failures
    remediation: |
      - Add empathy to system error messages
      - Acknowledge user inconvenience
      - Show that the product cares about the failure
  - id: ERRTONE-MED-002
    signal: Errors don't match brand voice
    evidence_indicators:
    - Error tone differs from product personality
    - Errors feel like different product
    - Too formal or too casual vs brand
    remediation: |
      - Align error messages with brand voice guidelines
      - Maintain personality while being helpful
      - Balance empathy with professionalism
  - id: ERRTONE-MED-003
    signal: Error handling inconsistent UX patterns
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some errors modal, some inline, some toast
    - Different visual treatment across errors
    - No standard error component
    remediation: |
      - Standardize error UX patterns
      - Create error component in design system
      - Use consistent visual treatment
  low:
  - id: ERRTONE-LOW-001
    signal: No personality in error messages
    evidence_indicators:
    - All errors purely functional
    - No warmth or character
    - Could be any product
    remediation: |
      - Add appropriate personality where fitting
      - Balance helpfulness with brand voice
      - Consider illustration for major errors
  positive:
  - id: ERRTONE-POS-001
    signal: Helpful, non-blaming error messages
    evidence_indicators:
    - Errors focus on situation, not user
    - Clear guidance for recovery
    - Empathetic tone maintained
  - id: ERRTONE-POS-002
    signal: Specific, actionable error guidance
    evidence_indicators:
    - Errors explain exactly what's wrong
    - Clear steps to fix provided
    - Alternative paths offered
  - id: ERRTONE-POS-003
    signal: Consistent error experience
    evidence_indicators:
    - All errors follow same tone
    - Consistent UX patterns
    - Brand voice maintained
