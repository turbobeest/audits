description:
  what: |
    Verifies the authenticity and validity of all trust seals, security
    badges, certification marks, and third-party endorsement logos displayed
    on the website. Checks that displayed seals link to verification pages,
    represent current/valid certifications, and comply with issuing
    organization guidelines. Identifies any fake, expired, or improperly
    used trust indicators.
  why_it_matters: |
    Trust seals are powerful conversion tools, but they can be easily faked
    by copying images. Displaying invalid, expired, or fake trust seals is
    potentially fraudulent and creates significant legal and reputational
    risk. Sophisticated users may verify seals, and finding fake badges
    destroys trust entirely. Invalid seals also violate certification body
    terms and can result in legal action.
  when_to_run:
  - Annually as part of trust signal audit
  - After website redesigns
  - When certifications are renewed or expire
  - Before major marketing campaigns
  - If competitors or users raise authenticity concerns

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SEAL-CRIT-001
    signal: Fake or unauthorized trust seal displayed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Seal image copied without authorization
    - Clicking seal does not lead to verification
    - Certification body has no record of organization
    - Seal claims certification never actually obtained
    explanation: |
      Displaying unauthorized trust seals is potentially fraudulent
      and creates significant legal and reputational risk. This can
      result in legal action from certification bodies, consumer
      protection complaints, and total destruction of user trust.
    remediation: |
      - Remove all unauthorized trust seals immediately
      - Audit all seals against actual certifications
      - Only display seals for valid, current certifications
      - Implement approval process before adding new seals
  - id: SEAL-CRIT-002
    signal: Expired certification still displaying active seal
    evidence_indicators:
    - Certification expired but seal still shown
    - Verification link shows expired status
    - Certification documentation shows past dates
    explanation: |
      Displaying seals for expired certifications is misleading
      and potentially fraudulent. Users rely on these seals as
      current validation of security practices.
    remediation: |
      - Remove or update expired seals immediately
      - Implement calendar tracking for certification renewals
      - Create process to update seals upon renewal
  - id: SEAL-CRIT-003
    signal: Trust seal links to unrelated or suspicious domain
    evidence_indicators:
    - Seal links to domain that isn't the seal provider
    - Verification page doesn't match seal shown
    - Link redirects through suspicious intermediaries
    explanation: |
      Malicious actors may link seals to fake verification pages.
      This indicates either compromise or intentional deception.
    remediation: |
      - Verify all seal links go to official provider domains
      - Check for link tampering or injection
      - Replace compromised seals with fresh implementations
  high:
  - id: SEAL-HIGH-001
    signal: Trust seals not clickable or lack verification link
    evidence_indicators:
    - Seal is static image with no link
    - Clicking seal does nothing
    - No way for users to verify seal authenticity
    explanation: |
      Static seals without verification are a red flag to savvy
      users who know real seals should be verifiable. This pattern
      is associated with fake or copied seals.
    remediation: |
      - Implement dynamic seals from providers where available
      - Ensure all seals link to verification pages
      - Use official seal implementation scripts, not images
  - id: SEAL-HIGH-002
    signal: Seal scope doesn't match display context
    evidence_indicators:
    - SOC 2 seal shown but certification scope is different product
    - PCI-DSS seal displayed but payment processing is outsourced
    - Certification covers parent company, not this specific service
    explanation: |
      Displaying seals outside their certified scope is misleading.
      Users may believe they're protected by certification that
      doesn't actually apply to the service they're using.
    remediation: |
      - Clarify seal scope on trust/security pages
      - Remove seals from areas outside certification scope
      - Obtain certification for products/services currently displaying seals
  - id: SEAL-HIGH-003
    signal: Using outdated or obsolete seal designs
    evidence_indicators:
    - Seal uses old logo or branding
    - BBB seal uses design from previous decade
    - SSL seal references deprecated technology
    explanation: |
      Outdated seal designs suggest seals may not be current,
      and may violate certification body brand guidelines.
    remediation: |
      - Update to current seal designs from providers
      - Register for updated assets from certification bodies
      - Establish process to refresh seals when designs change
  medium:
  - id: SEAL-MED-001
    signal: No documented ownership of seal relationships
    evidence_indicators:
    - Unclear who added seals or when
    - No record of certification ownership
    - Team cannot explain seal origin
    remediation: |
      - Document all seal authorizations and owners
      - Maintain certification documentation centrally
      - Track seal additions with approval process
  - id: SEAL-MED-002
    signal: Seals implemented as static images only
    evidence_indicators:
    - All seals are img tags with no scripts
    - No real-time verification capability
    - Seals could be easily copied/faked
    remediation: |
      - Implement dynamic seals where providers offer them
      - Use JavaScript-based seal implementations for verification
      - At minimum, ensure seals link to verification pages
  - id: SEAL-MED-003
    signal: Inconsistent seal display across site
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different seals on different pages with no logic
    - Some pages have seals, others missing
    - Seal quality varies (some high-res, some pixelated)
    remediation: |
      - Standardize seal display in design system
      - Ensure consistent placement across transaction pages
      - Use high-quality, official seal assets everywhere
  low:
  - id: SEAL-LOW-001
    signal: Too many trust seals creating clutter
    evidence_indicators:
    - More than 6-8 seals displayed together
    - Seals creating visual noise
    - Diminishing trust from excessive signaling
    remediation: |
      - Prioritize 3-5 most recognized/relevant seals
      - Group secondary seals in expandable section
  positive:
  - id: SEAL-POS-001
    signal: All seals verified and current
    evidence_indicators:
    - Every seal links to valid verification
    - All certifications are current
    - Documentation exists for each seal
  - id: SEAL-POS-002
    signal: Dynamic seal implementation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Seals use provider JavaScript for real-time verification
    - Seals would fail to display if certification lapsed
