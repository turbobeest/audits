  what: |
    Evaluates the overall professional quality of visual design, assessing
    how design elements communicate credibility, competence, and trustworthiness.
    Reviews visual consistency, typography quality, image quality, color palette
    coherence, layout structure, whitespace usage, and overall polish. Identifies
    design defects that undermine trust such as mismatched fonts, low-resolution
    images, broken layouts, or amateurish aesthetics.
  why_it_matters: |
    Research shows 75% of users judge a company's credibility based solely on
    website aesthetics. Users form judgments within 50 milliseconds of viewing
    a site. Poor design quality signals lack of attention to detail, limited
    resources, or unprofessionalism - all of which erode trust and increase
    bounce rates. The "amelioration effect" demonstrates that better visual
    treatment increases perceived credibility for identical content in 90% of cases.
  when_to_run:
  - Before major launches or campaigns
  - During brand refresh or redesign
  - When bounce rates are higher than expected
  - After user feedback mentions unprofessional appearance
  - During competitive analysis

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DESIGN-CRIT-001
    signal: Major visual defects visible on key pages
    evidence_indicators:
    - Broken layouts or overlapping elements
    - Missing images showing broken image icons
    - Obvious visual bugs on homepage or checkout
    - Completely unstyled content (failed CSS load)
    explanation: |
      Major visual defects create immediate credibility destruction.
      Users assume if the company can't manage basic website quality,
      they can't be trusted with more important things.
    remediation: |
      - Implement visual regression testing
      - Fix all layout breaks immediately
      - Ensure robust error handling for failed assets
      - Test across browsers before deployment
  - id: DESIGN-CRIT-002
    signal: Extremely outdated or amateur design aesthetic
    evidence_indicators:
    - Design appears 10+ years old
    - Uses dated patterns (flash-era styling, 3D buttons, web 1.0 aesthetics)
    - Multiple conflicting design styles on same page
    - Obvious template/stock look with no customization
    explanation: |
      Severely dated design signals the business may be inactive,
      underfunded, or not invested in customer experience. This
      dramatically reduces trust and conversion rates.
    remediation: |
      - Plan for design refresh or redesign
      - At minimum, update most dated elements
      - Consider professional design consultation
      - Prioritize high-traffic pages
  high:
  - id: DESIGN-HIGH-001
    signal: Inconsistent typography throughout site
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple unrelated fonts used
    - Inconsistent heading sizes/weights
    - System fonts appearing where custom fonts expected
    - Font sizes vary unpredictably
    explanation: |
      Typography inconsistency signals lack of attention to detail
      and undermines visual coherence. Users perceive this as
      unprofessional and untrustworthy.
    remediation: |
      - Audit all font usage across site
      - Establish typography scale in design system
      - Limit to 2-3 complementary fonts
      - Ensure font loading is robust
  - id: DESIGN-HIGH-002
    signal: Low-quality or inconsistent imagery
    evidence_indicators:
    - Pixelated or blurry images
    - Stretched/distorted images
    - Mix of photo styles (some professional, some amateur)
    - Generic stock photos that feel inauthentic
    explanation: |
      Image quality directly impacts perceived brand quality.
      Low-quality images suggest the business doesn't care about
      presentation or lacks resources for quality assets.
    remediation: |
      - Audit all images for quality issues
      - Replace low-resolution images
      - Establish image quality standards
      - Consider custom photography vs. generic stock
  - id: DESIGN-HIGH-003
    signal: Chaotic or unpredictable color usage
    evidence_indicators:
    - Too many colors without clear palette
    - Clashing color combinations
    - Inconsistent use of brand colors
    - Low contrast making text hard to read
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent color creates visual chaos that feels
      unprofessional. It suggests lack of design oversight
      and attention to brand presentation.
    remediation: |
      - Define and document color palette
      - Limit to primary, secondary, and accent colors
      - Audit for off-palette color usage
      - Verify all contrast ratios meet WCAG
  - id: DESIGN-HIGH-004
    signal: Poor layout and spacing
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cramped content with insufficient whitespace
    - Inconsistent margins and padding
    - Misaligned elements
    - Content touching edges uncomfortably
    explanation: |
      Proper spacing creates visual breathing room and professionalism.
      Cramped or misaligned layouts feel rushed and amateurish.
    remediation: |
      - Establish spacing scale (8px base, etc.)"
      - Audit alignment across components
      - Add sufficient whitespace around content
      - Use consistent padding in containers
  medium:
  - id: DESIGN-MED-001
    signal: Inconsistent component styling
    evidence_indicators:
    - Buttons look different across pages
    - Cards have varying styles
    - Forms styled inconsistently
    - Icons from different icon sets
    remediation: |
      - Build or enforce design system components
      - Audit and standardize button styles
      - Unify icon set usage
      - Create component documentation
  - id: DESIGN-MED-002
    signal: Mobile design significantly worse than desktop

    - Mobile layout feels like afterthought
    - Elements too small to tap
    - Horizontal scrolling required
    - Content overflow on small screens
    remediation: |
      - Audit mobile experience separately
      - Treat mobile as primary design target
      - Test across device sizes
      - Fix tap target sizes
  - id: DESIGN-MED-003
    signal: Visual hierarchy unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - Important elements don't stand out
    - Everything feels equally weighted
    - Primary actions not visually prominent
    - Users can't quickly scan content
    remediation: |
      - Establish clear heading hierarchy
      - Use size/weight/color to create emphasis
      - Make primary CTAs visually dominant
      - Add visual breaks between sections
  low:
  - id: DESIGN-LOW-001
    signal: Minor inconsistencies across pages
    evidence_indicators:
    - Slight variations in spacing
    - Minor font rendering differences
    - Subtle color variations
