  what: |
    Evaluates the visibility, accessibility, and completeness of contact
    information throughout the user interface. Assesses whether users can
    easily find phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, live
    chat options, and support channels. Reviews placement, prominence, and
    the variety of contact options offered to accommodate different user
    preferences.
  why_it_matters: |
    Visible contact information is a fundamental trust signal that demonstrates
    the business is legitimate, approachable, and responsive. For users on the
    fence about conversion, accessible contact details can be the deciding factor.
    Hidden or absent contact information raises suspicion about legitimacy and
    creates anxiety when users have pre-purchase questions or post-purchase
    support needs.
  when_to_run:
  - During website redesigns
  - When conversion rates drop unexpectedly
  - Before launching in new markets
  - After customer feedback mentions difficulty reaching support
  - During competitive analysis

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CONTACT-CRIT-001
    signal: No contact information anywhere on site
    evidence_indicators:
    - No phone, email, or contact form found on any page
    - No contact page exists
    - Footer lacks any contact details
    explanation: |
      Complete absence of contact information is a major red flag
      that signals illegitimacy or unwillingness to support customers.
      This severely damages trust and conversion rates.
    remediation: |
      - Add contact page with multiple contact methods
      - Include phone/email in footer on all pages
      - Add support link to main navigation
  - id: CONTACT-CRIT-002
    signal: Contact information is fake or non-functional
    evidence_indicators:
    - Phone number does not work
    - Email addresses bounce
    - Contact form submissions fail
    - Chat always shows 'offline'
    explanation: |
      Non-functional contact information is worse than none at all.
      It actively deceives users and destroys trust when they attempt
      to reach out.
    remediation: |
      - Test all contact channels regularly
      - Remove or fix non-functional channels
      - Implement monitoring for contact channel uptime
  high:
  - id: CONTACT-HIGH-001
    signal: Contact info only accessible after many clicks
    evidence_indicators:
    - Contact page not in main navigation
    - Requires 3+ clicks to reach contact information
    - Contact buried in help center or FAQ
    explanation: |
      Hidden contact information signals that the business doesn't
      want to be reached. This creates anxiety for users with questions
      and reduces trust.
    remediation: |
      - Add Contact to main navigation
      - Include phone/email in header or footer
      - Ensure contact is reachable in 1-2 clicks from any page
  - id: CONTACT-HIGH-002
    signal: Only one contact method available
    evidence_indicators:
    - Only contact form, no phone or email
    - Only email, no immediate contact option
    - No accommodation for user preference
    explanation: |
      Different users prefer different contact methods. Phone-only
      excludes deaf users; form-only frustrates urgent inquiries;
      email-only lacks immediacy for time-sensitive issues.
    remediation: |
      - Offer minimum of 2-3 contact methods
      - Include at least one real-time option (phone or chat)
      - Consider regional preferences for contact methods
  - id: CONTACT-HIGH-003
    signal: Contact info disappears on checkout/transaction pages
    evidence_indicators:
    - Checkout flow removes header/footer contact
    - No support option during payment process
    - Users cannot get help during critical transaction
    explanation: |
      Transaction pages are high-anxiety moments where users may have
      last-minute questions. Removing contact options here increases
      abandonment.
    remediation: |
      - Keep support link visible during checkout
      - Consider live chat on checkout pages
      - At minimum, include help link or phone number

      - Clearly communicate response times for other channels
