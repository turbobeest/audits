  what: |
    Evaluates how compliance certifications, industry accreditations, and
    third-party validations (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.) are
    displayed throughout the user interface. Assesses badge placement,
    validity verification, proper usage according to certification bodies'
    guidelines, and whether supporting documentation (trust centers,
    attestation letters) is accessible to users and procurement teams.
  why_it_matters: |
    Compliance certifications are powerful trust-building tools that
    communicate security maturity to customers, prospects, and partners.
    Poor display (footer-only badges, expired certifications, improper
    logo usage) wastes this trust-building opportunity and can signal
    weak controls to sophisticated buyers. For B2B/enterprise sales,
    visible certifications often determine vendor shortlist inclusion
    and reduce procurement friction.
  when_to_run:
  - After achieving new certifications
  - During website redesigns
  - Annually to verify certification validity display
  - Before enterprise sales campaigns
  - When updating security/trust center pages

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CERT-CRIT-001
    signal: Expired certification still displayed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Badge displayed for certification that has lapsed
    - Validity date on trust center is in the past
    - Audit period shown on badge does not include current date
    explanation: |
      Displaying expired certifications is potentially fraudulent and
      creates significant legal and reputational risk. Sophisticated
      buyers may verify validity and lose trust entirely.
    remediation: |
      - Immediately remove or update expired certification badges
      - Implement calendar reminders for certification renewals
      - Create process to update badges upon renewal completion
  - id: CERT-CRIT-002
    signal: Certification claimed but never actually achieved
    evidence_indicators:
    - Badge displayed for certification organization has not completed
    - No documentation exists to support displayed certification
    - Procurement team cannot verify claim
    explanation: |
      False certification claims are fraud and can result in contract
      termination, legal action, and severe reputational damage.
    remediation: |
      - Remove all unverified certification claims immediately
      - Audit all displayed badges against actual certifications
      - Implement approval process before adding new badges
  high:
  - id: CERT-HIGH-001
    signal: Improper logo usage violating certification body guidelines
    evidence_indicators:
    - Modified colors or sizing of official badges
    - Missing required disclaimers or registration marks
    - Using unofficial or outdated badge designs
    explanation: |
      Certification bodies like AICPA have strict logo usage requirements.
      Violations can result in loss of permission to display badges
      and signals carelessness to knowledgeable buyers.
    remediation: |
      - Review certification body logo guidelines
      - Register with certification bodies to receive official assets
      - Replace non-compliant badges with approved versions
  - id: CERT-HIGH-002
    signal: Certification badges only in footer with no context
    evidence_indicators:
    - Badges relegated to site footer only
    - No dedicated trust/security page explaining certifications
    - No way for prospects to verify or request documentation
    explanation: |
      Footer-only badges waste trust-building opportunity. Enterprise
      buyers and procurement teams need context, scope information,
      and access to reports to complete due diligence.
    remediation: |
      - Create dedicated trust center or security page
      - Explain what each certification means in plain language
      - Provide process for requesting attestation reports
      - Display badges strategically on conversion pages
  - id: CERT-HIGH-003
    signal: Certification scope not clearly communicated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Badge displayed but scope unclear (which products/services)
    - Users might assume certification covers everything
    - Trust center lacks scope documentation
    explanation: |
      Certifications have specific scopes. Displaying badges without
      clarifying scope can mislead customers about what is actually
      certified and create compliance issues.
    remediation: |
      - Document certification scope on trust center
      - Clarify which products/services are covered
      - Update marketing to match actual scope
  medium:
  - id: CERT-MED-001
    signal: No process for requesting attestation reports
    evidence_indicators:
    - Trust center exists but no download or request mechanism
    - Prospects must email for reports
    - NDA process for reports is cumbersome
    remediation: |
      - Create self-service report request flow
      - Consider gated download with business email
      - Streamline NDA process for sensitive reports
  - id: CERT-MED-002
    signal: Inconsistent badge display across channels
    evidence_indicators:
    - Website shows different certifications than sales materials
    - Badge styling varies between pages
    - Some channels missing certifications entirely
    remediation: |
      - Create brand guidelines for certification display
      - Audit all channels for consistency
      - Centralize badge assets for team access
  - id: CERT-MED-003
    signal: Certifications not leveraged in sales process
    evidence_indicators:
    - Sales decks lack certification information
    - Pricing pages don't mention security credentials
    - RFP responses require manual gathering of certification data
    remediation: |
      - Add certification slides to sales deck
      - Create RFP-ready certification summary document
      - Train sales team on certification positioning
  low:
  - id: CERT-LOW-001
    signal: No plain-language explanation of certifications

      - Focus on customer benefits, not technical details
