  what: |
    Evaluates the transparency and accessibility of company information
    throughout the digital experience. Assesses About Us pages, team
    information, company history, mission/values, physical location,
    legal entity details, leadership profiles, and overall corporate
    identity transparency. Reviews how well the organization communicates
    who they are, what they do, and why they can be trusted.
  why_it_matters: |
    Studies show 94% of consumers are more likely to be loyal to brands
    offering complete transparency. Hidden company information raises
    legitimacy concerns and erodes trust. Users want to know who is
    behind a product or service before committing their data or money.
    Clear company information signals professionalism, accountability,
    and willingness to stand behind promises.
  when_to_run:
  - During brand refresh or website redesign
  - Before launching in new markets
  - When trust or legitimacy concerns emerge in feedback
  - During due diligence for B2B partnerships
  - After company milestones (funding, acquisition, leadership change)

signals:
  critical:
  - id: COMPANY-CRIT-001
    signal: No About Us page or company information
    evidence_indicators:
    - No About page exists
    - Company name only, no additional context
    - Anonymous or unattributed product/service
    explanation: |
      Complete absence of company information is a major red flag
      that signals potential illegitimacy. Users cannot determine
      who they are dealing with, making trust impossible.
    remediation: |
      - Create comprehensive About Us page
      - Include company story, mission, and team
      - Add physical address and contact information
      - Display legal entity information
  - id: COMPANY-CRIT-002
    signal: Misleading or false company information
    evidence_indicators:
    - Address doesn't exist or is obviously fake
    - Team members don't exist on LinkedIn or elsewhere
    - Company registration cannot be verified
    explanation: |
      False company information indicates potential fraud or deception.
      Users who verify and find discrepancies will lose all trust
      and may report the site as fraudulent.
    remediation: |
      - Audit all displayed information for accuracy
      - Remove or correct any misleading claims
      - Ensure verifiable consistency across all channels
  high:
  - id: COMPANY-HIGH-001
    signal: No team or leadership information visible
    evidence_indicators:
    - No team page or leadership section
    - No founder or CEO identified
    - Completely faceless organization
    explanation: |
      Faceless companies trigger suspicion. Users want to know
      real people stand behind a product. B2B buyers especially
      need to evaluate leadership credibility.
    remediation: |
      - Add leadership page with executive profiles
      - Include photos, backgrounds, and LinkedIn links
      - Consider featuring key team members beyond executives
  - id: COMPANY-HIGH-002
    signal: No physical address or location information
    evidence_indicators:
    - No headquarters location mentioned
    - No registered address in footer
    - Country of operation unclear
    explanation: |
      Missing location information suggests the company may be
      hiding something or operating from an illegitimate location.
      Users need to know jurisdiction for legal recourse.
    remediation: |
      - Display headquarters address
      - Include registered address in footer/legal pages
      - Show office locations if multiple
  - id: COMPANY-HIGH-003
    signal: Company story lacks authenticity markers
    evidence_indicators:
    - Generic corporate boilerplate text
    - No founding story or history
    - No specific dates, milestones, or verifiable claims
    explanation: |
      Generic About Us content feels manufactured and untrustworthy.
      Authentic companies have specific stories, founding dates,
      and verifiable milestones.
    remediation: |
      - Write authentic founding story with specific details
      - Include timeline of company milestones
      - Add verifiable facts (founding date, location, key events)

      - Differentiate from generic industry language
