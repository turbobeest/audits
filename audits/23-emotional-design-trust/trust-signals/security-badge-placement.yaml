  what: |
    Evaluates the strategic placement of security badges, trust seals, and
    security indicators throughout the user interface. Assesses whether
    badges appear at decision-critical moments (checkout, form submission,
    account creation) and follow visual hierarchy best practices including
    F-pattern scanning alignment, proximity to calls-to-action, and
    appropriate density to avoid "defensive design anxiety."
  why_it_matters: |
    According to Baymard Institute research, 19% of users have abandoned a
    checkout flow because they "didn't trust the site with their credit card
    information." Security badge placement directly impacts conversion rates,
    with properly placed badges increasing form completion by 15-25% in
    financial contexts. Poor placement (footer-only, wrong timing, excessive
    density) can actually decrease conversions by up to 12% by raising
    security concerns users hadn't considered.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching checkout or payment flows
  - During conversion optimization audits
  - After redesigning key transaction pages
  - When cart abandonment rates increase unexpectedly
  - Before expanding to new markets or audiences

signals:
  critical:
  - id: BADGE-CRIT-001
    signal: No security badges on checkout or payment pages
    evidence_indicators:
    - Payment form has no SSL seal or security indicators
    - Checkout page lacks any trust badges near submit button
    - Credit card form appears without payment processor logos
    explanation: |
      Checkout pages without security indicators trigger maximum user
      anxiety at the most critical conversion moment. Baymard research
      shows 19% of users abandon checkout due to trust concerns.
    remediation: |
      - Add SSL seal near payment form fields
      - Display recognized payment processor logos (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
      - Include "Secure checkout" text indicator near submit button
      - Consider McAfee Secure, Norton, or TrustE seals if applicable
  - id: BADGE-CRIT-002
    signal: Security badges only appear in footer across entire site
    evidence_indicators:
    - Trust seals relegated to site footer only
    - No badges visible near forms or CTAs
    - User must scroll to bottom to find any trust indicators
    explanation: |
      Footer-only placement means trust reassurance arrives too late
      in the decision process. Users scanning in F-pattern never see
      badges when making purchase decisions.
    remediation: |
      - Move key badges to checkout page near payment fields
      - Add inline trust indicators next to sensitive form fields
      - Keep footer badges but add strategic placement at decision points
  high:
  - id: BADGE-HIGH-001
    signal: Badge overload creating visual clutter
    evidence_indicators:
    - More than 5-6 trust badges displayed in close proximity
    - Badges competing for attention near primary CTA
    - User feedback mentions page looks 'spammy' or 'desperate'
    - A/B tests show badge additions decreased conversion
    explanation: |
      Research shows an inverted U-curve for badge density. Excessive
      badges create "defensive design anxiety" - users wonder why so
      many reassurances are needed, raising suspicions.
    remediation: |
      - Reduce to 2-4 most recognized/relevant badges
      - Group secondary badges into expandable section
      - A/B test removing low-recognition badges
  - id: BADGE-HIGH-002
    signal: Badges not visible on mobile devices
    evidence_indicators:
    - Trust badges hidden or cropped on mobile viewport
    - Badges too small to be recognizable on mobile
    - Mobile checkout flow lacks badges visible on desktop
    explanation: |
      Mobile users are often more cautious due to screen limitations.
      Missing mobile trust signals significantly impact mobile conversion
      rates when mobile traffic dominates.
    remediation: |
      - Audit all badge placements on mobile viewports
      - Ensure badges scale appropriately (not too small)
      - Consider mobile-specific badge placement near thumb zones
  - id: BADGE-HIGH-003
    signal: Trust signals presented too early in funnel
    evidence_indicators:
    - Homepage dominated by security messaging
    - Product pages emphasize security over value
    - Trust badges appear before users have shown purchase intent
    explanation: |
      Premature trust signals can raise questions users hadn't considered.
      Showing security badges before users want the product shifts
      attention from value proposition to risk consideration.
    remediation: |
      - Move heavy security messaging to later funnel stages
      - Lead with value on early pages, trust at decision points
      - Save intensive trust signals for checkout flow
  medium:
  - id: BADGE-MED-001
    signal: Badge placement inconsistent across transaction flow
    evidence_indicators:
    - Badges appear on cart page but not checkout
    - Different badge styles or positions on different pages
    - Trust signal continuity broken between funnel steps
    remediation: |
      - Audit entire transaction flow for badge consistency
      - Establish placement guidelines in design system
      - Ensure badges persist through checkout flow
  - id: BADGE-MED-002
    signal: Badges far from call-to-action buttons
    evidence_indicators:
    - Trust seals positioned in sidebar away from buy button
    - Badges not in visual proximity to form submit buttons
    - Eye-tracking shows users don't scan badge location
    remediation: |
      - Position badges within visual proximity of CTAs
      - Place SSL seal immediately above or below submit button
      - Consider inline badges next to form fields
  - id: BADGE-MED-003
    signal: Low-contrast or poorly visible badges
    evidence_indicators:
    - Badges blend into background
    - Badge colors don't provide sufficient contrast
    - Users report not noticing security indicators
    remediation: |
      - Ensure badges meet WCAG contrast requirements
      - Use high-contrast design for security indicators
      - Test badge visibility in user research
  low:
  - id: BADGE-LOW-001
    signal: No payment method logos displayed
    evidence_indicators:
    - Accepted payment methods not shown until payment step
    - Users must guess which cards are accepted
    remediation: |
      - Add payment method logos to checkout/cart pages
      - Display accepted methods early in purchase flow
  positive:
  - id: BADGE-POS-001
    signal: Strategic badge placement at decision points
    evidence_indicators:
    - Trust badges appear near payment form fields
    - SSL seal positioned above submit button
    - Moderate badge density (2-4 relevant badges)
  - id: BADGE-POS-002
    signal: Responsive badge design for all devices
    evidence_indicators:
    - Badges visible and appropriately sized on mobile
    - Placement adapts to viewport without hiding badges
    - Touch-friendly badge sizing on mobile
