  what: |
    Evaluates the quality and emotional impact of the welcome experience for
    new users. Examines the moment of account creation through first value
    realization: welcome emails, first-login experience, onboarding flows,
    personalization setup, and initial guidance. Assesses whether the welcome
    creates positive first impressions, builds excitement, and sets users up
    for success.
  why_it_matters: |
    Welcome experience research shows:
    - First impressions form within 50ms and persist
    - 76% of users expect personalized welcome experiences
    - Effective welcome increases 30-day retention by 30-50%
    - Poor welcome is leading cause of trial abandonment

    The welcome is the foundation of the user relationship - it sets
    expectations, demonstrates value, and creates emotional connection
    that influences long-term engagement.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching new user acquisition campaigns
  - When trial-to-paid conversion is below benchmark
  - During onboarding optimization initiatives
  - After significant product changes affect new users
  - When user feedback mentions confusing starts

signals:
  critical:
  - id: WELCOME-CRIT-001
    signal: No welcome experience - dropped directly into product
    evidence_indicators:
    - New users land on complex dashboard immediately
    - No orientation or guidance offered
    - No welcome email sent
    - First-time users see same experience as veterans
    explanation: |
      Dropping users into a complex product without welcome creates
      overwhelm and signals that the product doesn't care about their
      success. This drives immediate abandonment.
    remediation: |
      - Design distinct first-run experience
      - Add welcome modal or flow for new users
      - Implement welcome email sequence
      - Guide users to first value moment
  - id: WELCOME-CRIT-002
    signal: Welcome experience is overwhelming
    evidence_indicators:
    - Too many steps before seeing value
    - Information overload in first session
    - Required setup is lengthy
    - Users report confusion in feedback
    explanation: |
      Overwhelming welcome exhausts users before they experience value.
      Every additional step before value increases abandonment risk.
    remediation: |
      - Minimize required setup steps
      - Progressive disclosure - reveal features over time
      - Get to first value quickly, then expand
      - Make extensive setup optional
  high:
  - id: WELCOME-HIGH-001
    signal: Welcome lacks personalization
    evidence_indicators:
    - Generic welcome for all user types
    - No use case or role-based customization
    - Same welcome regardless of acquisition source
    - Name not used in welcome messages
    explanation: |
      Generic welcome misses opportunity to show understanding of
      user needs. Personalized welcome increases engagement significantly.
    remediation: |
      - Personalize welcome by user attributes
      - Customize for different use cases/roles
      - Use name in greetings
      - Reference acquisition context if known
  - id: WELCOME-HIGH-002
    signal: Path to first value unclear
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users don't know what to do first
    - No clear first action suggested
    - Value proposition not tied to first steps
    - Users wander without direction
    explanation: |
      If users don't quickly understand how to get value, they'll
      leave. Welcome must create clear path to first success.
    remediation: |
      - Define single clear first action
      - Connect first action to value promise
      - Reduce friction to first value moment
      - Celebrate when first value achieved
  - id: WELCOME-HIGH-003
    signal: Welcome emails not aligned with in-app experience
    evidence_indicators:
    - Email says one thing, app shows another
    - Email CTA leads to wrong place
    - Messaging inconsistent across touchpoints
    - Users confused by mismatched guidance
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent welcome across channels confuses users and
      undermines trust. All touchpoints must tell coherent story.
    remediation: |
      - Audit all welcome touchpoints for consistency
      - Align email CTAs with in-app experience
      - Use consistent terminology and guidance
      - Create unified welcome journey map

    remediation: |
      - Add warmth and personality to welcome

      - Preview the value they'll experience
      - Create anticipation for what's possible
  - id: WELCOME-MED-002
    signal: No progress indication during setup
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users don't know how much setup remains
    - No step indicators

    remediation: |
      - Add progress indicator to setup flows
      - Show step count (Step 2 of 3)
      - Indicate time remaining if predictable
  - id: WELCOME-MED-003
    signal: Welcome doesn't set expectations
    evidence_indicators:
    - Users don't know what to expect
    - No explanation of how product works
    - Surprises later that could have been previewed
    remediation: |
      - Preview what users will experience
