  what: |
    Evaluates how the product recognizes and rewards loyal, long-term users.
    Examines tenure-based benefits, loyalty programs, early adopter recognition,
    power user acknowledgment, and special treatment for committed customers.
    Assesses whether loyalty is meaningfully recognized or if long-term users
    are taken for granted while acquisition is prioritized.
  why_it_matters: |
    Loyalty recognition research shows:
    - Unrecognized loyalty is #1 reason for at-risk long-term churn
    - Loyal users who feel recognized are 5x more valuable advocates
    - Loyalty recognition increases lifetime value by 20-30%
    - New user promotions without loyalty perks create resentment

    Long-term users represent significant investment - recognizing their
    loyalty maintains engagement and creates powerful advocates.
  when_to_run:
  - When long-term user churn increases
  - When implementing or reviewing loyalty programs
  - During customer experience improvement initiatives
  - When user feedback mentions feeling unvalued
  - After launching promotions that favor new users

signals:
  critical:
  - id: LOYALTY-CRIT-001
    signal: No differentiation for long-term users
    evidence_indicators:
    - No recognition for tenure
    - Same experience for new and 5-year users
    - No loyalty benefits or program
    - Long-term users feel invisible
    explanation: |
      Treating loyal users identically to new users signals their
      commitment doesn't matter. This invites them to consider
      alternatives and undermines advocacy potential.
    remediation: |
      - Implement tenure recognition
      - Create loyalty benefits tier
      - Acknowledge milestones
      - Differentiate experience for loyal users
  - id: LOYALTY-CRIT-002
    signal: Better promotions for new users than loyal ones
    evidence_indicators:
    - New user discounts unavailable to existing
    - Win-back offers better than loyalty rewards
    - Long-term users see ads for deals they can't get
    - User complaints about unfair pricing
    explanation: |
      When disloyal behavior is rewarded more than loyalty, loyal
      users feel betrayed. This creates resentment and encourages
      churning to get win-back offers.
    remediation: |
      - Match or exceed new user offers for loyal users
      - Create loyalty-exclusive benefits
      - Don't show inaccessible promotions
      - Reward loyalty, not disloyalty
  high:
  - id: LOYALTY-HIGH-001
    signal: Loyalty recognition is purely transactional
    evidence_indicators:
    - Points or discounts only
    - No emotional recognition
    - No acknowledgment of relationship
    - Feels like a transaction, not recognition
    explanation: |
      Purely transactional loyalty programs miss emotional connection.
      Recognition should make users feel valued, not just rewarded.
    remediation: |
      - Add emotional recognition components
      - Acknowledge relationship duration
      - Personalize recognition
      - Express genuine appreciation
  - id: LOYALTY-HIGH-002
    signal: Loyalty benefits not meaningful
    evidence_indicators:
    - Benefits too small to notice
    - Benefits irrelevant to user needs
    - Complicated to redeem
    - Users don't know about benefits
    explanation: |
      Loyalty benefits that don't feel meaningful fail to recognize
      loyalty effectively. Benefits must be valuable and accessible.
    remediation: |
      - Design meaningful benefits
      - Align with what users actually want
      - Make benefits easy to access
      - Communicate benefits clearly
  - id: LOYALTY-HIGH-003
    signal: Early adopters forgotten
    evidence_indicators:
    - No recognition for early adopters
    - Features they helped shape have no credit
    - Same treatment as users who joined yesterday
    explanation: |
      Early adopters took risks and provided feedback that shaped
      the product. Not recognizing them alienates important advocates.
    remediation: |
      - Create early adopter recognition
      - Grandfather favorable terms
      - Acknowledge contributions
      - Maintain special relationship
  medium:
  - id: LOYALTY-MED-001
    signal: No loyalty program structure
    evidence_indicators:

    remediation: |
      - Create structured loyalty program
      - Define clear tiers and benefits
      - Communicate program to users
  - id: LOYALTY-MED-002
    signal: Loyal users don't get early access
    evidence_indicators:
    - New features roll out same to all
    - No beta access for loyal users
    - No input into roadmap
    remediation: |
      - Offer early access to loyal users
      - Create beta programs
      - Seek roadmap input from committed users
  - id: LOYALTY-MED-003
    signal: Power users not recognized in community
    evidence_indicators:
