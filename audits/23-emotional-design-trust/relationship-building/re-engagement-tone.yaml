  what: |
    Evaluates the tone and approach of communications designed to bring
    back inactive or lapsed users. Examines re-engagement emails, push
    notifications, win-back campaigns, and returning-user experiences
    for appropriate tone: avoiding guilt, respecting user autonomy,
    providing genuine value, and creating warm (not desperate) outreach.
  why_it_matters: |
    Re-engagement tone significantly affects return rates:
    - Guilt-based messaging decreases return by 20%
    - Value-focused re-engagement increases return by 35%
    - Desperate tone damages brand perception even if user doesn't return
    - Respectful outreach maintains relationship for future

    How you reach out to lapsed users reflects brand values and
    affects perception among all users who see the messaging.
  when_to_run:
  - Before launching win-back campaigns
  - When reviewing lifecycle marketing programs
  - When re-engagement rates are below benchmark
  - After user feedback about annoying emails
  - During brand voice refinement

signals:
  critical:
  - id: REENGAGE-CRIT-001
    signal: Re-engagement uses guilt or shame
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''We miss you'' or similar guilt language'
    - Counting days since last login
    - Making user feel bad for not using
    - Implying user abandoned something
    explanation: |
      Guilt-based re-engagement creates negative associations with
      the product. Users return feeling bad, or don't return and
      have negative brand perception.
    remediation: |
      - Remove all guilt language
      - Focus on value user might want
      - Respect user's right to pause
      - Lead with what's new or useful
  - id: REENGAGE-CRIT-002
    signal: Re-engagement is threatening
    evidence_indicators:
    - Account deletion threats
    - Data loss warnings
    - Ultimatum language
    - Fear-based motivation
    explanation: |
      Threatening users damages trust and brand perception.
      Even if users return, they do so resentfully. Most will
      churn permanently with negative word-of-mouth.
    remediation: |
      - Remove threat language
      - Reassure data is safe
      - Give control to user
      - Make return welcoming not forced
  high:
  - id: REENGAGE-HIGH-001
    signal: Re-engagement frequency excessive
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple re-engagement emails per week
    - Push notifications too frequent
    - Escalating desperation in sequence
    - Users report feeling harassed
    explanation: |
      Excessive outreach signals desperation and annoys users.
      It can drive users to unsubscribe or develop negative
      brand associations.
    remediation: |
      - Limit re-engagement frequency
      - Space messages appropriately
      - Don't escalate desperation
      - Have clear stop after sequence
  - id: REENGAGE-HIGH-002
    signal: Re-engagement provides no value
    evidence_indicators:
    - Just asks user to come back
    - No new features or content mentioned
    - No personalized reason to return
    - Generic messages
    explanation: |
      Users left for a reason. Re-engagement must provide a reason
      to return - new value, improvements, relevant content.
      Just asking provides no motivation.
    remediation: |
      - Lead with what's new or improved
      - Personalize based on user's interests
      - Offer something of value
      - Give genuine reason to return
  - id: REENGAGE-HIGH-003
    signal: Returning user experience not optimized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Returning users see same experience as before
    - No acknowledgment of return
    - Dropped into complex state
    - Previous context lost
    explanation: |
      Returning users need re-orientation. Dropping them into
      complex state without welcome back discourages re-engagement.
    remediation: |
      - Detect and acknowledge returning users
      - Provide gentle re-onboarding
      - Highlight what's new since they left
      - Make return frictionless
  medium:
  - id: REENGAGE-MED-001
    signal: Re-engagement not personalized
    evidence_indicators:
    - Same message to all lapsed users
    - No reference to user's context
    - Generic content
    remediation: |
      - Personalize by user's usage patterns
      - Reference their specific data/work
      - Tailor to why they might have left
  - id: REENGAGE-MED-002
    signal: No easy opt-out from re-engagement
    evidence_indicators:
    - Can't stop re-engagement without full unsubscribe
    - Preference controls limited
    - Opt-out not respected
    remediation: |
      - Offer easy re-engagement opt-out
      - Respect preferences
      - Provide granular controls
  - id: REENGAGE-MED-003
    signal: Re-engagement timing poor
    evidence_indicators:
    - Messages at inconvenient times
    - Too soon after user leaves
    - Not aligned with user's patterns
    remediation: |
      - Time messages appropriately
      - Wait reasonable period before outreach
      - Consider user's timezone and patterns

    signal: Re-engagement lacks brand personality
