  what: |
    Evaluates how the product acknowledges user milestones throughout their
    journey: anniversaries, achievement unlocks, usage milestones, skill
    progression, community contributions, and relationship duration markers.
    Assesses whether acknowledgments strengthen user relationships, create
    positive memories, and reinforce continued engagement.
  why_it_matters: |
    Milestone psychology research shows:
    - Anniversary acknowledgments increase retention by 15-25%
    - Usage milestones create "sunk cost" commitment
    - Recognition satisfies fundamental belonging needs
    - Milestones create shareable moments driving referrals

    Products that celebrate user journeys create deeper emotional bonds
    and give users reasons to stay and advocate.
  when_to_run:
  - When designing lifecycle marketing programs
  - During retention optimization initiatives
  - When implementing gamification features
  - During competitive experience benchmarking
  - When long-term users are churning

signals:

  - id: MILESTONE-CRIT-001
    signal: No milestone acknowledgment system exists
    evidence_indicators:
    - No anniversaries or milestones acknowledged
    - Users reach significant points unrecognized
    - No lifecycle communications
    - Tenure has no recognition
    explanation: |
      Users who receive no recognition feel like anonymous transactions.
      Milestones are easy opportunities to strengthen relationships
      that competitors likely use.
    remediation: |
      - Identify key milestone moments in user journey
      - Implement anniversary acknowledgments (1mo, 1yr)
      - Add usage milestone recognition
      - Create email and in-app acknowledgment
  high:
  - id: MILESTONE-HIGH-001
    signal: Milestones acknowledged without personalization
    evidence_indicators:
    - Generic 'Congrats!' without specifics
    - No reflection on individual journey
    - Same acknowledgment for everyone
    - No user-specific data included
    explanation: |
      Generic acknowledgment feels automated and impersonal.
      Personalized milestones create genuine connection.
    remediation: |
      - Include user-specific stats and history
      - Reference actual achievements, not just time
      - Make each acknowledgment feel earned
  - id: MILESTONE-HIGH-002
    signal: Major milestones missed or under-celebrated
    evidence_indicators:
    - Long tenure users get no acknowledgment
    - Significant usage levels pass silently
    - Major achievements not recognized
    explanation: |
      Missing major milestones signals the product doesn't value
      the user's commitment. Long-term users expect recognition.
    remediation: |
      - Map all significant milestone moments
      - Ensure major points have acknowledgment
      - Scale celebration to milestone significance
  - id: MILESTONE-HIGH-003
    signal: Milestone acknowledgment feels transactional
    evidence_indicators:
    - Milestones used only to upsell
    - Acknowledgment immediately pivots to ask
    - Celebration feels like marketing
    explanation: |
      Milestones that immediately turn to sales feel exploitative.
      Acknowledgment should celebrate, not sell.
    remediation: |
      - Lead with genuine celebration
      - Separate acknowledgment from selling
      - If offers included, make them feel like gifts
