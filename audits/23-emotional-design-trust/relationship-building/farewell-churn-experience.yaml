  what: |
    Evaluates the experience of users leaving or canceling: account deletion,
    subscription cancellation, downgrade flows, and final communications.
    Assesses whether the farewell is graceful, respects user autonomy, avoids
    dark patterns, provides data portability, leaves door open for return,
    and maintains positive brand perception even in departure.
  why_it_matters: |
    Farewell experience matters significantly:
    - 30% of churned users return within a year if farewell was positive
    - Negative churn experience drives negative word-of-mouth
    - Dark patterns create regulatory risk and brand damage
    - Graceful departure creates potential future customers/advocates

    How you say goodbye reflects brand values and affects perception
    among remaining customers who consider the possibility of leaving.
  when_to_run:
  - During churn reduction initiatives
  - When reviewing cancellation flows for dark patterns
  - Before regulatory compliance review
  - When churn feedback mentions difficult cancellation
  - During competitive experience benchmarking

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FAREWELL-CRIT-001
    signal: Cancellation option hidden or difficult to find
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cancel button buried in deep menus
    - Different path than other account settings
    - Requires support contact to cancel
    - Users report difficulty finding cancel
    explanation: |
      Hiding cancellation is a dark pattern that violates user trust
      and increasingly violates regulations. Users forced to search
      develop negative sentiment.
    remediation: |
      - Make cancellation discoverable in account settings
      - Same prominence as other account actions
      - No harder to find than signup was
      - Support self-service cancellation
  - id: FAREWELL-CRIT-002
    signal: Cancellation requires phone call or chat
    evidence_indicators:
    - No self-service cancellation
    - Must call/chat to cancel
    - Long wait times to reach support
    - Available hours limited
    explanation: |
      Requiring human contact to cancel is a retention dark pattern
      that frustrates users and is increasingly regulated (e.g.,
      FTC 'click-to-cancel' requirements).
    remediation: |
      - Enable self-service cancellation
      - Allow same ease as signup
      - If call required, minimize wait
      - Offer callback option
  - id: FAREWELL-CRIT-003
    signal: Aggressive guilt or manipulation in cancellation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Guilt-inducing copy ('We'll miss you')
    - Sad illustrations or mascots
    - Warnings that feel like threats
    - Manipulative confirm/cancel button labels
    explanation: |
      Guilt-based retention damages brand perception and creates
      regulatory risk. Users who feel manipulated will never return
      and will warn others.
    remediation: |
      - Remove emotional manipulation
      - Use neutral, helpful tone
      - Respect user's decision
      - Offer alternatives without guilt
  high:
  - id: FAREWELL-HIGH-001
    signal: Excessive steps or friction in cancellation
    evidence_indicators:
    - Many more steps than signup
    - Multiple confirmation dialogs
    - Progress resets or loops
    - Unexpected complications
    explanation: |
      Excessive friction is a dark pattern called "roach motel" -
      easy to get in, hard to get out. This frustrates users and
      attracts regulatory attention.
    remediation: |
      - Minimize cancellation steps
      - Single confirmation sufficient
      - Clear progress indication
      - No harder than signing up
  - id: FAREWELL-HIGH-002
    signal: No data export before cancellation
    evidence_indicators:
    - No export option available
    - Export not offered during cancellation
    - Data hostage to continued subscription
    - Non-standard or incomplete export
    explanation: |
      Users have right to their data. Not offering export traps
      users and creates negative farewell. GDPR and other regulations
      require data portability.
    remediation: |
      - Offer complete data export
      - Standard, portable formats
      - Prompt during cancellation
      - Include all user-created data
  - id: FAREWELL-HIGH-003
    signal: Misleading button labels in cancellation
    evidence_indicators:
    - '''Cancel'' button cancels the cancellation'
    - Confirm button unclear which action it confirms
    - Color coding designed to mislead
    - Users accidentally keep subscribed
    explanation: |
      Confusingly labeled buttons trick users into staying subscribed.
      This dark pattern is increasingly regulated and damages trust.
    remediation: |
      - Clear, unambiguous button labels
      - "Confirm cancellation" for actual cancel
      - Consistent with rest of product
      - Test for user understanding
  medium:
  - id: FAREWELL-MED-001
    signal: No feedback collection in cancellation
    evidence_indicators:
    - No exit survey
    - No opportunity to share why leaving
    - Feedback not used for improvement
    remediation: |
      - Add optional exit survey
      - Keep survey brief (1-3 questions)
      - Make it clearly optional
      - Use feedback for improvement
  - id: FAREWELL-MED-002
    signal: Farewell communication cold or absent
    evidence_indicators:
    - No cancellation confirmation
    - Confirmation is purely transactional
    - No acknowledgment of relationship
    - No path back communicated
    remediation: |
      - Send graceful farewell email
      - Acknowledge relationship
      - Provide clear end date/terms
      - Leave door open for return
  - id: FAREWELL-MED-003
    signal: Retention offers unclear or difficult to decline
    evidence_indicators:
    - Offers obscure the cancel path
    - Declining offer is difficult
    - Multiple offers in sequence
    remediation: |
      - Present retention offers clearly
      - Easy to decline with single click
      - Limit to one meaningful offer
      - Don't block cancellation
  low:
  - id: FAREWELL-LOW-001
    signal: No win-back pathway in farewell
    evidence_indicators:
    - No mention of how to return
    - No special offer for future return
    - Bridge burned in departure
    remediation: |
      - Include return instructions
      - Consider win-back offer
      - Maintain positive relationship
  positive:
  - id: FAREWELL-POS-001
