description:
  what: |
    This audit examines how effectively cost information is communicated
    and made accessible throughout the organization. It evaluates cost
    reporting clarity, stakeholder access to relevant data, and the
    ability of teams to understand and act on their cost information.
  why_it_matters: |
    Cost transparency is essential for creating a cost-aware culture.
    When teams cannot easily access and understand their costs, they
    cannot make informed trade-offs or optimize their spending. The
    FinOps Foundation emphasizes that transparency is a prerequisite
    for accountability and continuous improvement.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly FinOps maturity assessment
  - When establishing or improving FinOps practices
  - After implementing new cost management tools
  - During organizational cost culture assessments

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TRANS-CRIT-001
    signal: Cost data not accessible to cost owners
    evidence_pattern: Teams cannot view their own cost data
    explanation: |
      When teams cannot access their cost information, they cannot
      be held accountable for their spending or make optimization
      decisions. This fundamentally undermines FinOps practices.
    remediation: Implement self-service cost access for all cost owners
  high:
  - id: TRANS-HIGH-001
    signal: Cost reports not understandable to technical teams
    evidence_pattern: Reports use finance terminology without context
    explanation: |
      Technical teams need cost information presented in terms they
      understand (cost per request, cost per deployment, etc.).
      Finance-centric reports fail to drive engineering optimization.
    remediation: Create engineering-focused cost views with technical context
  - id: TRANS-HIGH-002
    signal: No proactive communication of cost anomalies
    evidence_pattern: Anomalies discovered only in retrospective reports
    explanation: |
      Delayed awareness of cost spikes reduces the opportunity to
      respond and prevents learning from the root cause while it
      is still fresh.
    remediation: Implement proactive anomaly alerts to cost owners
  medium:
  - id: TRANS-MED-001
    signal: Cost reports lack trend analysis and comparisons
    evidence_pattern: Point-in-time data only, no historical context
    remediation: Add trend lines, period-over-period comparisons
  - id: TRANS-MED-002
    signal: Infrequent cost reporting cadence
    evidence_threshold: reports_frequency > monthly
    remediation: Increase reporting frequency to at least weekly
  low:
  - id: TRANS-LOW-001
    signal: No standardized cost reporting format across teams
    evidence_pattern: Inconsistent report formats and metrics
    remediation: Standardize cost reporting templates
  positive:
  - id: TRANS-POS-001
    signal: Self-service cost dashboards available to all teams
  - id: TRANS-POS-002
    signal: Real-time cost visibility with proactive alerting
  - id: TRANS-POS-003
    signal: Cost reports include actionable recommendations
