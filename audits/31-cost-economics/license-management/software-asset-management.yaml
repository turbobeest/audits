description:
  what: |
    This audit evaluates the organization's software asset management
    program including discovery, inventory, compliance, and lifecycle
    management capabilities. It assesses maturity against ISO 19770
    standards and industry best practices.
  why_it_matters: |
    A mature SAM program reduces software costs by 20-30%, minimizes
    compliance risk, and provides accurate data for IT decisions.
    Without SAM, organizations cannot effectively manage their software
    estate, leading to waste and exposure.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual SAM program review
  - When establishing SAM program
  - Before major software initiatives
  - During IT governance reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SAM-CRIT-001
    signal: No software asset management program
    evidence_pattern: No SAM processes or tools
    explanation: |
      Without a SAM program, the organization has no visibility
      into its software estate, creating compliance risk and
      cost inefficiency.
    remediation: Establish formal SAM program
  high:
  - id: SAM-HIGH-001
    signal: No automated software discovery
    evidence_pattern: Manual inventory only
    explanation: |
      Manual inventory cannot keep pace with software changes.
      Automated discovery is essential for accurate visibility.
    remediation: Implement automated discovery tools
  - id: SAM-HIGH-002
    signal: License inventory incomplete
    evidence_pattern: Missing license records for deployed software
    explanation: |
      Incomplete license records prevent accurate compliance
      assessment and optimization analysis.
    remediation: Establish complete license inventory
  medium:
  - id: SAM-MED-001
    signal: SAM not integrated with procurement
    evidence_pattern: Disconnected software purchasing
    remediation: Integrate SAM with procurement process
  - id: SAM-MED-002
    signal: No software lifecycle management
    evidence_pattern: No version or retirement tracking
    remediation: Implement software lifecycle management
  low:
  - id: SAM-LOW-001
    signal: SAM program not documented
    evidence_pattern: Informal processes only
    remediation: Document SAM policies and procedures
