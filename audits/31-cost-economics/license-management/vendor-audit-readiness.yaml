description:
  what: |
    This audit assesses the organization's preparedness for software
    vendor audits. It evaluates documentation quality, evidence
    gathering capabilities, compliance position, and the ability
    to respond effectively to audit requests.
  why_it_matters: |
    Vendor audits can result in significant unplanned expenses.
    Being unprepared increases costs through penalties, rushed
    purchases, and poor negotiating position. Audit readiness
    minimizes financial exposure and stress.
  when_to_run:
  - Annually for high-risk vendors
  - When audit notification received
  - After major deployments
  - During compliance program reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: AUDR-CRIT-001
    signal: Cannot produce proof of license for deployed software
    evidence_pattern: Missing license documentation
    explanation: |
      Inability to prove license ownership during an audit
      is treated as non-compliance, resulting in penalties
      and required purchases at unfavorable terms.
    remediation: Locate or reconstruct license records
  - id: AUDR-CRIT-002
    signal: Known compliance gaps without remediation plan
    evidence_pattern: Documented non-compliance
    explanation: |
      Known compliance gaps should be remediated before an
      audit. Voluntary disclosure may achieve better terms
      than audit discovery.
    remediation: Create and execute remediation plan
  high:
  - id: AUDR-HIGH-001
    signal: Cannot produce accurate deployment evidence
    evidence_pattern: No discovery capability for audit scope
    explanation: |
      Without accurate deployment data, organizations cannot
      effectively respond to audit requests or negotiate
      from an informed position.
    remediation: Implement discovery for audit-relevant software
  - id: AUDR-HIGH-002
    signal: No audit response process defined
    evidence_pattern: No documented audit response procedure
    explanation: |
      Ad-hoc audit responses are inefficient and risky.
      A defined process ensures consistent, timely, and
      effective responses.
    remediation: Document audit response procedure
  medium:
  - id: AUDR-MED-001
    signal: License documentation scattered and unorganized
    evidence_pattern: No centralized license repository
    remediation: Centralize license documentation
  - id: AUDR-MED-002
    signal: No regular compliance self-assessment
    evidence_pattern: No proactive compliance monitoring
    remediation: Implement regular self-assessment
  low:
  - id: AUDR-LOW-001
    signal: No audit history tracking
    evidence_pattern: No record of past audits
    remediation: Track audit history and outcomes
  positive:
  - id: AUDR-POS-001
    signal: Audit-ready documentation available
  - id: AUDR-POS-002
    signal: Defined audit response process
  - id: AUDR-POS-003
    signal: Regular proactive compliance assessment
