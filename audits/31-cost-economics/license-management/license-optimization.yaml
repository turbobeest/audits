  what: |
    This audit identifies opportunities to reduce software licensing
    costs through optimization strategies including right-sizing,
    alternative license types, vendor consolidation, and renegotiation.
    It balances cost reduction with operational needs.
  why_it_matters: |
    Software licensing is often 15-30% of IT budgets. Many organizations
    over-license by 20-40%. License optimization can yield significant
    savings without impacting operations. Understanding license economics
    enables better negotiation and procurement decisions.
  when_to_run:
  - Before renewal negotiations
  - Annually during budget planning
  - After mergers or organizational changes
  - During cost reduction initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: LOPT-CRIT-001
    signal: Significant unused licenses (shelf-ware)
    evidence_threshold: unused_licenses > 30% of total
    explanation: |
      Unused licenses represent direct cost waste. If 30%+
      of licenses are unused, substantial savings opportunity
      exists through reclamation or non-renewal.
    remediation: Reclaim and right-size license holdings
  high:
  - id: LOPT-HIGH-001
    signal: More expensive license type than needed
    evidence_pattern: Enterprise licenses for limited features
    explanation: |
      Organizations often purchase enterprise or premium licenses
      when standard editions would suffice. This overspend can
      be 40-60% of license cost.
    remediation: Evaluate downgrade to appropriate edition
  - id: LOPT-HIGH-002
    signal: License consolidation opportunity
    evidence_pattern: Multiple vendors for same capability
    explanation: |
      Using multiple vendors for similar functionality fragments
      spend and reduces negotiating leverage.
    remediation: Consolidate vendors where practical
  medium:
  - id: LOPT-MED-001
    signal: Renewal approaching without optimization review
    evidence_pattern: Auto-renewing without analysis
    remediation: Review usage before renewal
  - id: LOPT-MED-002
    signal: Open source alternatives not considered
    evidence_pattern: Commercial software for OSS-available needs
    remediation: Evaluate OSS alternatives
  low:
  - id: LOPT-LOW-001
    signal: No license cost tracking by business unit
    evidence_pattern: Centralized license cost without allocation
    remediation: Implement license cost allocation
  positive:
  - id: LOPT-POS-001
    signal: Regular license optimization reviews
  - id: LOPT-POS-002
    signal: Usage-based procurement decisions
  - id: LOPT-POS-003
    signal: Active license reclamation process
