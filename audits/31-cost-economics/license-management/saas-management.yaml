  what: |
    This audit examines SaaS subscription management including
    discovery of all SaaS applications, utilization tracking,
    duplicate application identification, and optimization of
    subscription tiers and counts.
  why_it_matters: |
    SaaS sprawl is a significant cost driver. Studies show 30-40%
    of SaaS licenses are unused or underutilized. Without visibility,
    organizations pay for shadow IT, duplicate applications, and
    abandoned subscriptions. SaaS management recovers significant waste.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly SaaS review
  - Before annual renewals
  - During cost reduction initiatives
  - When implementing SaaS management

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SAAS-CRIT-001
    signal: No visibility into total SaaS spend
    evidence_pattern: Unknown SaaS subscriptions
    explanation: |
      Without SaaS visibility, organizations cannot manage
      costs, security, or compliance. Shadow IT creates
      uncontrolled spend and risk.
    remediation: Implement SaaS discovery and inventory
  - id: SAAS-CRIT-002
    signal: High percentage of unused SaaS licenses
    evidence_threshold: unused_licenses > 40%
    explanation: |
      Paying for unused SaaS licenses is pure waste. At 40%+
      unused, significant savings opportunity exists.
    remediation: Reclaim unused licenses
  high:
  - id: SAAS-HIGH-001
    signal: Duplicate SaaS applications for same function
    evidence_pattern: Multiple project management, video conferencing tools
    explanation: |
      Duplicate applications fragment data, reduce collaboration,
      and waste money. Consolidation improves efficiency and
      reduces cost.
    remediation: Consolidate duplicate applications
  - id: SAAS-HIGH-002
    signal: No renewal management process
    evidence_pattern: Auto-renewals without review
    explanation: |
      Automatic renewals without review perpetuate waste and
      miss optimization opportunities. Proactive renewal
      management is essential.
    remediation: Implement renewal calendar and review process
  medium:
  - id: SAAS-MED-001
    signal: SaaS purchases bypassing IT
    evidence_pattern: Direct expense reimbursements for SaaS
    remediation: Implement SaaS procurement policy
  - id: SAAS-MED-002
    signal: No centralized SaaS contract management
    evidence_pattern: Contracts scattered across organization
    remediation: Centralize contract management
  low:
  - id: SAAS-LOW-001
    signal: No SaaS usage analytics
    evidence_pattern: Unknown engagement levels
    remediation: Implement usage tracking
  positive:
  - id: SAAS-POS-001
