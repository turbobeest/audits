  what: |
    This audit examines cloud and IT cost forecasting capabilities
    including forecasting methodology, accuracy tracking, inputs
    and assumptions, and integration with business planning. It
    evaluates both short-term operational and long-term strategic
    forecasting.
  why_it_matters: |
    Accurate forecasting enables proactive financial management,
    better commitment decisions (RIs, Savings Plans), and alignment
    with business planning. Poor forecasting leads to budget
    surprises, missed optimization opportunities, and reduced
    credibility with finance.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly forecast review
  - During budget planning
  - Before commitment purchases
  - When establishing FinOps practices

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FCST-CRIT-001
    signal: No cost forecasting capability
    evidence_pattern: No forecasts produced
    explanation: |
      Without forecasting, organizations cannot proactively
      manage costs, make informed commitment decisions, or
      align with business planning.
    remediation: Implement basic forecasting capability
  - id: FCST-CRIT-002
    signal: Forecast accuracy consistently below 70%
    evidence_threshold: mape > 30%
    explanation: |
      Highly inaccurate forecasts provide little value and
      may lead to poor decisions. Consistent inaccuracy
      indicates fundamental methodology issues.
    remediation: Review and improve forecasting methodology
  high:
  - id: FCST-HIGH-001
    signal: Forecasting does not incorporate business drivers
    evidence_pattern: Trend-only forecasting
    explanation: |
      Pure trend extrapolation misses business changes that
      impact costs. Driver-based forecasting provides more
      accurate predictions.
    remediation: Incorporate business drivers into forecasting
  - id: FCST-HIGH-002
    signal: No forecast accuracy tracking
    evidence_pattern: Forecasts not compared to actuals
    explanation: |
      Without tracking accuracy, forecasting cannot improve.
      Understanding forecast errors enables methodology
      refinement.
    remediation: Implement forecast accuracy tracking
  medium:
  - id: FCST-MED-001
    signal: Forecast assumptions not documented
    evidence_pattern: Unstated assumptions
    remediation: Document all forecast assumptions
  - id: FCST-MED-002
    signal: Single forecast without scenarios
    evidence_pattern: No best/worst case scenarios
    remediation: Develop scenario-based forecasts
  low:
  - id: FCST-LOW-001
    signal: Manual forecasting process
    evidence_pattern: Spreadsheet-based forecasting
    remediation: Automate forecasting where possible
  positive:
  - id: FCST-POS-001
    signal: Forecast accuracy consistently above 90%
  - id: FCST-POS-002
    signal: Driver-based forecasting integrated with business
  - id: FCST-POS-003
    signal: Regular forecast review and refinement
