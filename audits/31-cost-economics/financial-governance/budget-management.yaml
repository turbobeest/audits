  what: |
    This audit examines IT and cloud budget management processes
    including budget planning methodology, tracking mechanisms,
    variance analysis, and integration with corporate financial
    planning. It evaluates the maturity and effectiveness of
    budget governance.
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective budget management ensures financial predictability
    and accountability. Poor budget practices lead to overruns,
    surprise costs, and inability to demonstrate IT value. Good
    budgeting enables informed investment decisions and builds
    trust with finance leadership.
  when_to_run:
  - During annual budget planning
  - Quarterly budget reviews
  - After significant variances
  - During FinOps program establishment

signals:
  critical:
  - id: BUDM-CRIT-001
    signal: No formal IT/cloud budget process
    evidence_pattern: Ad-hoc spending without budget
    explanation: |
      Without a formal budget, spending is uncontrolled and
      unpredictable. This creates financial risk and prevents
      informed prioritization of investments.
    remediation: Establish formal budget process
  - id: BUDM-CRIT-002
    signal: Budget variances exceeding 25% without explanation
    evidence_threshold: variance > 25%
    explanation: |
      Large unexplained variances indicate lack of control
      and visibility. This damages credibility with finance
      and leadership.
    remediation: Investigate variances and improve forecasting
  high:
  - id: BUDM-HIGH-001
    signal: Budget tracking not frequent enough
    evidence_threshold: tracking_frequency > monthly
    explanation: |
      Cloud costs can change rapidly. Monthly or less frequent
      tracking allows issues to grow before detection.
    remediation: Increase tracking frequency to at least weekly
  - id: BUDM-HIGH-002
    signal: Budget not aligned with organizational structure
    evidence_pattern: Single IT budget without team allocation
    explanation: |
      Without team-level budgets, accountability is diluted
      and teams cannot manage their own costs.
    remediation: Allocate budgets to teams and cost centers
  medium:
  - id: BUDM-MED-001
    signal: No reforecasting process
    evidence_pattern: Annual budget only, no updates
    remediation: Implement quarterly reforecasting
  - id: BUDM-MED-002
    signal: Cloud budget separate from IT budget
    evidence_pattern: Disconnected budget processes
    remediation: Integrate cloud into overall IT budget
  low:
  - id: BUDM-LOW-001
    signal: Budget process not documented
    evidence_pattern: Informal procedures only
    remediation: Document budget process
  positive:
  - id: BUDM-POS-001
    signal: Integrated budget with corporate finance
  - id: BUDM-POS-002
    signal: Real-time budget tracking with alerting
  - id: BUDM-POS-003
    signal: Team-level budget accountability
