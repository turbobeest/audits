  what: |
    This audit examines technology vendor management practices
    including contract management, renewal processes, negotiation
    effectiveness, and relationship management. It evaluates the
    organization's ability to optimize vendor relationships.
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective vendor management can yield 10-30% cost savings
    through better negotiations, consolidated purchases, and
    proactive renewals. Poor vendor management leads to unfavorable
    terms, missed opportunities, and fragmented spending.
  when_to_run:
  - Before major contract renewals
  - Annually during budget planning
  - When consolidating vendors
  - During cost reduction initiatives

signals:
  critical:
  - id: VEND-CRIT-001
    signal: No centralized contract management
    evidence_pattern: Contracts scattered without tracking
    explanation: |
      Without centralized contract management, organizations
      miss renewal dates, cannot leverage spend across
      agreements, and lose negotiating position.
    remediation: Implement centralized contract management
  high:
  - id: VEND-HIGH-001
    signal: Renewals occurring without negotiation
    evidence_pattern: Auto-renewals at list price
    explanation: |
      Automatic renewals without negotiation miss significant
      savings opportunities. Even maintaining status quo
      typically requires negotiation effort.
    remediation: Implement proactive renewal management
  - id: VEND-HIGH-002
    signal: Fragmented spend across similar vendors
    evidence_pattern: Multiple vendors for same capability
    explanation: |
      Fragmented spend reduces negotiating leverage and
      increases management overhead. Consolidation enables
      better terms.
    remediation: Consolidate vendors where appropriate
  medium:
  - id: VEND-MED-001
    signal: No vendor performance management
    evidence_pattern: Vendor SLAs not tracked
    remediation: Implement vendor performance tracking
  - id: VEND-MED-002
    signal: Limited market intelligence for negotiations
    evidence_pattern: Negotiations without benchmarks
    remediation: Use benchmarking data in negotiations
  low:
  - id: VEND-LOW-001
    signal: No strategic vendor relationship program
    evidence_pattern: Transactional vendor relationships
    remediation: Develop strategic vendor relationships
  positive:
  - id: VEND-POS-001
    signal: Proactive contract and renewal management
  - id: VEND-POS-002
    signal: Consolidated vendor strategy
  - id: VEND-POS-003
    signal: Benchmarked negotiations with documented savings
