  what: |
    This audit examines IT and cloud cost financial reporting
    including report content, quality, timeliness, distribution,
    and alignment with corporate financial standards. It evaluates
    reports for different audiences from executives to engineers.
  why_it_matters: |
    Financial reporting enables informed decision-making at all
    levels. Poor reporting hides problems, prevents optimization,
    and reduces trust. Good reporting provides actionable insights,
    builds credibility, and enables accountability.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly reporting review
  - When implementing FinOps
  - After stakeholder feedback
  - During finance alignment efforts

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FRPT-CRIT-001
    signal: No regular financial reporting
    evidence_pattern: No standard cost reports
    explanation: |
      Without regular reporting, cost trends and issues
      go undetected. Stakeholders lack the information
      needed for decision-making.
    remediation: Implement regular financial reporting
  high:
  - id: FRPT-HIGH-001
    signal: Reports not aligned with audience needs
    evidence_pattern: One-size-fits-all reporting
    explanation: |
      Different audiences have different needs. Executive
      reports should differ from engineering reports.
      Misaligned reports waste time and miss the mark.
    remediation: Create audience-appropriate reports
  - id: FRPT-HIGH-002
    signal: Reports not actionable
    evidence_pattern: Data without insights or recommendations
    explanation: |
      Reports that only show data without interpretation
      or next steps provide limited value. Actionable
      reports drive improvement.
    remediation: Add insights and recommendations to reports
  medium:
  - id: FRPT-MED-001
    signal: Reports delayed or inconsistent
    evidence_pattern: Variable timing or missed reports
    remediation: Automate and schedule report generation
  - id: FRPT-MED-002
    signal: Reports not integrated with corporate finance
    evidence_pattern: IT reports standalone from finance
    remediation: Align reporting with corporate standards
  low:
  - id: FRPT-LOW-001
    signal: No feedback mechanism for report improvement
    evidence_pattern: Static reports without refinement
    remediation: Implement report feedback process
  positive:
  - id: FRPT-POS-001
    signal: Tailored reports for different audiences
  - id: FRPT-POS-002
    signal: Automated, consistent reporting
  - id: FRPT-POS-003
    signal: Actionable insights driving improvement
