  what: |
    This audit examines cost-benefit analysis practices for
    technology decisions. It evaluates how costs and benefits
    are identified, quantified, and compared to support
    decision-making.
  why_it_matters: |
    Cost-benefit analysis is fundamental to sound technology
    decisions. Without rigorous CBA, decisions are based on
    incomplete information, gut feel, or vendor claims.
    Proper CBA ensures investments are justified and
    prioritized correctly.
  when_to_run:
  - Before major decisions
  - During governance reviews
  - When establishing decision frameworks
  - For continuous improvement

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CBA-CRIT-001
    signal: No cost-benefit analysis for decisions
    evidence_pattern: Decisions without CBA
    explanation: |
      Major decisions without CBA are not evidence-based.
      This leads to poor investment choices and inability
      to justify spending.
    remediation: Require CBA for significant decisions
  high:
  - id: CBA-HIGH-001
    signal: Benefits not quantified
    evidence_pattern: Qualitative benefits only
    explanation: |
      Unquantified benefits cannot be compared to costs
      or validated after implementation. Quantification
      enables accountability.
    remediation: Require benefit quantification
  - id: CBA-HIGH-002
    signal: Costs incomplete
    evidence_pattern: Direct costs only considered
    explanation: |
      Incomplete cost analysis understates true investment
      and overstates benefit ratio.
    remediation: Include all cost categories
  medium:
  - id: CBA-MED-001
    signal: No sensitivity analysis
    evidence_pattern: Single-point estimates only
    remediation: Include sensitivity analysis
  - id: CBA-MED-002
    signal: Assumptions not documented
    evidence_pattern: Unstated assumptions in analysis
    remediation: Document all assumptions
  low:
  - id: CBA-LOW-001
    signal: No CBA templates or standards
    evidence_pattern: Inconsistent analysis formats
    remediation: Standardize CBA templates
  positive:
  - id: CBA-POS-001
    signal: Rigorous CBA methodology in use
  - id: CBA-POS-002
    signal: Comprehensive cost and benefit identification
  - id: CBA-POS-003
    signal: CBA driving informed decisions
