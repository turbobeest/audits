  what: |
    This audit examines cloud economics modeling capabilities -
    the ability to estimate and predict cloud costs for different
    scenarios including architecture options, growth projections,
    and optimization strategies.
  why_it_matters: |
    Cloud economics modeling enables informed decisions about
    architecture, capacity, and optimization. Without modeling,
    decisions are made without understanding cost implications,
    leading to surprise costs and suboptimal architectures.
  when_to_run:
  - During architecture planning
  - Before major deployments
  - For capacity planning
  - During cost optimization

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CEM-CRIT-001
    signal: No cloud economics modeling capability
    evidence_pattern: Deployments without cost estimation
    explanation: |
      Without cost modeling, architectures are deployed
      without understanding cost implications. This leads
      to surprise costs and budget overruns.
    remediation: Implement cost modeling for deployments
  high:
  - id: CEM-HIGH-001
    signal: Cost models not validated against actuals
    evidence_pattern: Estimates not compared to reality
    explanation: |
      Unvalidated models may be systematically inaccurate.
      Comparing estimates to actuals improves model accuracy.
    remediation: Validate models against actual costs
  - id: CEM-HIGH-002
    signal: Models missing key cost components
    evidence_pattern: Compute only, no network/storage
    explanation: |
      Incomplete models underestimate costs. All significant
      cost components must be included.
    remediation: Expand models to include all cost components
  medium:
  - id: CEM-MED-001
    signal: No scenario modeling capability
    evidence_pattern: Single-point estimates only
    remediation: Implement scenario/sensitivity modeling
  - id: CEM-MED-002
    signal: Modeling not used for optimization analysis
    evidence_pattern: Ad-hoc optimization without modeling
    remediation: Use modeling for optimization planning
  low:
  - id: CEM-LOW-001
    signal: No standardized modeling templates
    evidence_pattern: Inconsistent modeling approaches
    remediation: Create standard modeling templates
  positive:
  - id: CEM-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive cost modeling capability
  - id: CEM-POS-002
    signal: Models validated and refined
  - id: CEM-POS-003
