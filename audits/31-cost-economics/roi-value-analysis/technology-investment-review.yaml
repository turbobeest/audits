  what: |
    This audit examines the technology investment review process
    including business case development standards, investment
    approval governance, and post-implementation review practices
    that validate investments deliver expected value.
  why_it_matters: |
    Rigorous investment review ensures technology spending
    delivers business value. Without proper review, investments
    may be approved without adequate justification, leading to
    waste. Post-implementation review enables learning and
    accountability.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual governance review
  - When establishing investment process
  - During portfolio reviews
  - After investment failures

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TIR-CRIT-001
    signal: No investment review process
    evidence_pattern: Technology investments without business cases
    explanation: |
      Without investment review, spending is not justified
      or prioritized. This leads to waste and misalignment
      with business objectives.
    remediation: Establish investment review process
  high:
  - id: TIR-HIGH-001
    signal: No post-implementation review
    evidence_pattern: Investments not validated against projections
    explanation: |
      Without post-implementation review, there is no
      accountability and no learning. Projections may be
      systematically optimistic.
    remediation: Implement post-implementation review
  - id: TIR-HIGH-002
    signal: Business cases lack rigor
    evidence_pattern: Missing cost/benefit analysis
    explanation: |
      Weak business cases do not provide adequate basis
      for investment decisions. Key components must be
      addressed.
    remediation: Strengthen business case requirements
  medium:
  - id: TIR-MED-001
    signal: Inconsistent investment thresholds
    evidence_pattern: No defined approval levels
    remediation: Define investment approval thresholds
  - id: TIR-MED-002
