  what: |
    This audit examines ROI measurement capabilities for technology
    investments including methodology, metrics, tracking mechanisms,
    and the use of ROI in decision-making. It evaluates both
    projected and actual ROI tracking.
  why_it_matters: |
    ROI measurement demonstrates technology value and guides
    investment decisions. Without ROI tracking, organizations
    cannot determine which investments deliver value, leading
    to continued funding of low-value initiatives and under-
    investment in high-value opportunities.
  when_to_run:
  - During investment planning
  - Post-implementation reviews
  - Annual portfolio reviews
  - During FinOps assessments

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ROI-CRIT-001
    signal: No ROI measurement for technology investments
    evidence_pattern: Investments made without ROI analysis
    explanation: |
      Without ROI measurement, investment decisions are not
      evidence-based. Organizations may fund low-value
      initiatives while missing high-value opportunities.
    remediation: Implement ROI analysis for investments
  high:
  - id: ROI-HIGH-001
    signal: ROI projections not validated against actuals
    evidence_pattern: No post-implementation ROI review
    explanation: |
      Without validation, ROI projections may be systematically
      optimistic. Tracking actual vs projected ROI improves
      future estimation accuracy.
    remediation: Implement post-implementation ROI review
  - id: ROI-HIGH-002
    signal: Benefits not quantified in measurable terms
    evidence_pattern: Qualitative benefits only
    explanation: |
      Benefits that cannot be measured cannot be verified.
      Quantifiable benefits enable accountability and
      accurate ROI calculation.
    remediation: Quantify benefits with measurable metrics
  medium:
  - id: ROI-MED-001
    signal: Inconsistent ROI methodology
    evidence_pattern: Different approaches across projects
    remediation: Standardize ROI methodology
  - id: ROI-MED-002
    signal: ROI not used in portfolio prioritization
    evidence_pattern: Investment decisions without ROI ranking
    remediation: Incorporate ROI into prioritization
  low:
  - id: ROI-LOW-001
    signal: No ROI reporting or communication
    evidence_pattern: ROI calculated but not shared
    remediation: Report ROI to stakeholders
  positive:
  - id: ROI-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive ROI methodology in use
  - id: ROI-POS-002
    signal: Regular post-implementation ROI review
  - id: ROI-POS-003
    signal: ROI driving investment decisions
