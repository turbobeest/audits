  what: |
    This audit examines showback processes where IT and cloud
    costs are displayed to business units for awareness without
    directly impacting their financial statements. It evaluates
    visibility, accessibility, and behavioral impact.
  why_it_matters: |
    Showback creates cost awareness as a precursor to or alternative
    to chargeback. It helps teams understand the costs they generate
    without the complexity of financial charges. When effective,
    showback drives cost-conscious behavior through transparency
    rather than financial impact.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly showback review
  - Before implementing chargeback
  - When assessing cost awareness
  - During FinOps maturity assessment

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SB-CRIT-001
    signal: No cost visibility provided to teams
    evidence_pattern: Teams cannot see their costs
    explanation: |
      Without any cost visibility, teams cannot understand
      or manage their consumption. This is the foundation
      of cost awareness.
    remediation: Implement basic showback capability
  high:
  - id: SB-HIGH-001
    signal: Showback data not actionable
    evidence_pattern: Raw data without context or guidance
    explanation: |
      Showing costs without context or recommendations does
      not drive behavior change. Teams need to understand
      what they can do with the information.
    remediation: Add context and recommendations to showback
  - id: SB-HIGH-002
    signal: Showback not reaching key stakeholders
    evidence_pattern: Reports sent but not consumed
    explanation: |
      Showback that is not consumed provides no value.
      Information must reach the right people in formats
      they will engage with.
    remediation: Improve showback delivery and accessibility
  medium:
  - id: SB-MED-001
    signal: Showback frequency insufficient
    evidence_pattern: Monthly or less frequent showback
    remediation: Increase showback frequency
  - id: SB-MED-002
    signal: No trend analysis in showback
    evidence_pattern: Point-in-time data only
    remediation: Add trends and comparisons
  low:
  - id: SB-LOW-001
    signal: No feedback loop from showback consumers
    evidence_pattern: Static reports without improvement
    remediation: Implement feedback mechanism
  positive:
  - id: SB-POS-001
    signal: Self-service showback widely used
  - id: SB-POS-002
    signal: Showback driving behavioral change
  - id: SB-POS-003
    signal: Actionable insights with recommendations
