description:
  what: |
    This audit examines the ability to track costs by project,
    initiative, or product. It evaluates tagging practices,
    tracking mechanisms, and the quality of project-level cost
    data for investment decisions and accountability.
  why_it_matters: |
    Project-level cost tracking enables understanding of true
    investment costs, ROI analysis, and go/no-go decisions.
    Without project tracking, organizations cannot determine
    which initiatives are consuming resources or delivering
    value.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly project cost review
  - During project closeout
  - Before major investment decisions
  - During FinOps assessments

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PCT-CRIT-001
    signal: No project-level cost tracking
    evidence_pattern: Cannot determine costs by project
    explanation: |
      Without project cost tracking, organizations cannot
      assess investment ROI, make informed decisions, or
      hold projects accountable for costs.
    remediation: Implement project cost tracking
  high:
  - id: PCT-HIGH-001
    signal: Project tagging inconsistent or incomplete
    evidence_pattern: Many resources missing project tags
    explanation: |
      Incomplete tagging means project costs are understated
      and unattributed costs are hidden in overhead.
    remediation: Improve project tagging coverage
  - id: PCT-HIGH-002
    signal: Project costs not reviewed during lifecycle
    evidence_pattern: Costs only reviewed at project end
    explanation: |
      Without ongoing cost review, projects can overrun
      budgets before issues are detected.
    remediation: Implement ongoing project cost review
  medium:
  - id: PCT-MED-001
    signal: Shared costs not allocated to projects
    evidence_pattern: Only direct costs tracked
    remediation: Include shared cost allocation for true cost
  - id: PCT-MED-002
    signal: Labor costs not tracked by project
    evidence_pattern: No time tracking for projects
    remediation: Implement project time tracking
  low:
  - id: PCT-LOW-001
    signal: No project cost reporting
    evidence_pattern: Data available but not reported
    remediation: Create project cost reports
  positive:
  - id: PCT-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive project cost tracking
  - id: PCT-POS-002
    signal: Regular project cost reviews
  - id: PCT-POS-003
    signal: Cost data used in project decisions
