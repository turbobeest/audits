  what: |
    This audit examines cost center structure and its alignment
    with IT and cloud cost allocation. It evaluates whether cost
    centers accurately represent the organizational hierarchy,
    enable appropriate cost tracking, and support financial
    reporting requirements.
  why_it_matters: |
    Cost centers are the organizational units to which costs are
    allocated. If cost centers do not align with how the organization
    operates and makes decisions, cost allocation is ineffective.
    Proper cost center structure enables meaningful accountability
    and reporting.
  when_to_run:
  - Annually or during organizational changes
  - When implementing cost allocation
  - After organizational restructuring
  - During FinOps setup

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CC-CRIT-001
    signal: Cost centers not aligned with organization
    evidence_pattern: Cost center structure differs from org chart
    explanation: |
      When cost centers do not match organizational structure,
      costs cannot be attributed to decision-makers, undermining
      accountability.
    remediation: Align cost centers with organization
  high:
  - id: CC-HIGH-001
    signal: Cost centers not maintained
    evidence_pattern: Orphaned or outdated cost centers
    explanation: |
      Cost centers that exist for departed teams or defunct
      projects create confusion and allocation issues.
    remediation: Clean up and maintain cost center data
  - id: CC-HIGH-002
    signal: Cost center coverage incomplete
    evidence_pattern: Costs without cost center allocation
    explanation: |
      Costs that cannot be assigned to cost centers create
      unallocated pools that undermine chargeback.
    remediation: Ensure all costs can be allocated
  medium:
  - id: CC-MED-001
    signal: Inconsistent cost center granularity
    evidence_pattern: Mixed levels of detail across organization
    remediation: Standardize cost center granularity
  - id: CC-MED-002
    signal: Cost center naming inconsistent
    evidence_pattern: No naming convention
    remediation: Implement naming standards
  low:
  - id: CC-LOW-001
    signal: No cost center governance process
    evidence_pattern: Ad-hoc cost center management
    remediation: Establish cost center governance
  positive:
  - id: CC-POS-001
    signal: Cost centers aligned with organization
  - id: CC-POS-002
    signal: Regular cost center maintenance
  - id: CC-POS-003
    signal: Consistent granularity and naming
