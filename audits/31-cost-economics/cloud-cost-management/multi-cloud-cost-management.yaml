description:
  what: |
    This audit examines cost management practices in multi-cloud
    environments. It evaluates unified cost visibility, normalized
    reporting, cross-cloud governance, and provider-specific
    optimization across AWS, Azure, GCP, and other cloud providers.
  why_it_matters: |
    Multi-cloud environments create cost management complexity.
    Without unified visibility, organizations cannot compare costs,
    make informed placement decisions, or implement consistent
    governance. Provider-specific optimization opportunities may
    be missed.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly multi-cloud review
  - When adopting new cloud providers
  - During cloud strategy planning
  - When consolidating cloud management

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MCC-CRIT-001
    signal: No unified view of multi-cloud costs
    evidence_pattern: Separate reporting by provider only
    explanation: |
      Without unified visibility, organizations cannot understand
      total cloud spend, compare provider costs, or make informed
      decisions about workload placement.
    remediation: Implement unified multi-cloud cost visibility
  - id: MCC-CRIT-002
    signal: Inconsistent tagging across cloud providers
    evidence_pattern: Different tagging standards by provider
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent tagging prevents accurate cross-cloud cost
      attribution and reporting. A unified tagging strategy
      is essential for multi-cloud cost management.
    remediation: Implement unified tagging standard across providers
  high:
  - id: MCC-HIGH-001
    signal: No normalized cost comparison between providers
    evidence_pattern: Cannot compare like-for-like costs
    explanation: |
      Different provider pricing models make comparison difficult.
      Without normalization, it is impossible to determine which
      provider is more cost-effective for workloads.
    remediation: Implement cost normalization for comparison
  - id: MCC-HIGH-002
    signal: Provider-specific optimizations not implemented
    evidence_pattern: Generic optimization only
    explanation: |
      Each provider has unique optimization opportunities (RIs,
      Savings Plans, Spot, etc.). Failing to leverage provider-
      specific features leaves savings on the table.
    remediation: Implement provider-specific optimization programs
  medium:
  - id: MCC-MED-001
    signal: Governance policies inconsistent across providers
    evidence_pattern: Different approval processes by provider
    remediation: Standardize governance across providers
  - id: MCC-MED-002
    signal: Workload placement decisions not cost-informed
    evidence_pattern: No TCO comparison for provider selection
    remediation: Include cost analysis in placement decisions
  low:
  - id: MCC-LOW-001
    signal: No regular multi-cloud cost review
    evidence_pattern: Ad-hoc review only
    remediation: Implement regular multi-cloud cost review
  positive:
  - id: MCC-POS-001
    signal: Unified cost visibility across all providers
  - id: MCC-POS-002
    signal: Consistent governance and tagging
  - id: MCC-POS-003
    signal: Provider-specific optimization programs
