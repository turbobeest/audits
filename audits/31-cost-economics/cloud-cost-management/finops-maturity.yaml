description:
  what: |
    This audit assesses the organization's FinOps maturity against
    the FinOps Foundation framework. It evaluates capabilities across
    the Inform, Optimize, and Operate phases, as well as cultural
    and organizational dimensions.
  why_it_matters: |
    FinOps maturity directly correlates with cloud cost efficiency.
    Organizations at higher maturity levels demonstrate 20-40% better
    cost efficiency than those at lower levels. Understanding current
    maturity guides investment in capability improvement.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual FinOps assessment
  - When establishing FinOps practice
  - Before major cloud initiatives
  - During budget planning cycles

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FOM-CRIT-001
    signal: No FinOps practice or ownership
    evidence_pattern: No dedicated cost management responsibility
    explanation: |
      Without dedicated FinOps ownership, cost management is
      fragmented and ineffective. Organizations need clear
      accountability for cloud financial management.
    remediation: Establish FinOps function with clear ownership
  - id: FOM-CRIT-002
    signal: No cost visibility or reporting
    evidence_pattern: Teams cannot see their costs
    explanation: |
      Cost visibility is the foundation of FinOps. Without it,
      no optimization or accountability is possible.
    remediation: Implement basic cost visibility and reporting
  high:
  - id: FOM-HIGH-001
    signal: Cost optimization is reactive only
    evidence_pattern: Optimization triggered by budget overruns
    explanation: |
      Reactive cost management means optimization only happens
      during crises. Proactive practices catch waste early
      and prevent budget issues.
    remediation: Implement proactive optimization processes
  - id: FOM-HIGH-002
    signal: Engineering not engaged in cost decisions
    evidence_pattern: Cost treated as finance-only concern
    explanation: |
      Engineers make most cost-impacting decisions but are
      often disconnected from cost data. Engagement is
      essential for optimization.
    remediation: Engage engineering in cost ownership
  medium:
  - id: FOM-MED-001
    signal: Limited automation in cost management
    evidence_pattern: Manual reports and optimization processes
    remediation: Automate cost reporting and alerting
  - id: FOM-MED-002
    signal: Inconsistent cost governance across teams
    evidence_pattern: Different practices in different groups
    remediation: Standardize cost governance processes
  low:
  - id: FOM-LOW-001
    signal: No FinOps community or knowledge sharing
    evidence_pattern: Siloed cost management knowledge
    remediation: Establish FinOps community of practice
  positive:
  - id: FOM-POS-001
    signal: Dedicated FinOps team or function
  - id: FOM-POS-002
    signal: Engineering actively participates in optimization
  - id: FOM-POS-003
    signal: Automated cost governance and alerting
