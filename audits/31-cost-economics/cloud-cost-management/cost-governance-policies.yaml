description:
  what: |
    This audit examines cloud cost governance policies including
    spending limits, approval workflows, resource creation policies,
    and preventive controls. It evaluates the effectiveness of
    governance in controlling costs while enabling innovation.
  why_it_matters: |
    Cost governance provides guardrails that prevent runaway spending
    while enabling teams to move quickly. Without effective governance,
    organizations either over-control (slowing innovation) or under-
    control (enabling waste). Balanced governance optimizes both.
  when_to_run:
  - Quarterly governance review
  - After cost overruns or incidents
  - When onboarding new teams
  - During compliance audits

signals:
  critical:
  - id: GOV-CRIT-001
    signal: No cost governance policies in place
    evidence_pattern: No SCPs, policies, or approval workflows
    explanation: |
      Without governance, any user with resource creation
      permissions can incur unlimited costs. This creates
      significant financial risk.
    remediation: Implement foundational cost governance policies
  - id: GOV-CRIT-002
    signal: Expensive resources creatable without approval
    evidence_pattern: No controls on large instance types
    explanation: |
      The ability to create expensive resources without
      oversight can lead to significant unplanned costs.
    remediation: Implement approval workflows for expensive resources
  high:
  - id: GOV-HIGH-001
    signal: No mandatory tagging enforcement
    evidence_pattern: Resources creatable without required tags
    explanation: |
      Without tagging enforcement, resources are created
      without cost attribution, undermining visibility
      and accountability.
    remediation: Enforce mandatory tagging at creation
  - id: GOV-HIGH-002
    signal: Governance policies not enforced
    evidence_pattern: Documented policies without technical controls
    explanation: |
      Policies that exist only in documentation are easily
      bypassed. Technical enforcement ensures compliance.
    remediation: Implement technical controls for policies
  medium:
  - id: GOV-MED-001
    signal: Governance too restrictive, blocking innovation
    evidence_pattern: Frequent exception requests approved
    remediation: Review and relax overly restrictive policies
  - id: GOV-MED-002
    signal: No regular governance policy review
    evidence_pattern: Policies unchanged for 12+ months
    remediation: Implement regular policy review process
  low:
  - id: GOV-LOW-001
    signal: Governance policies not documented
    evidence_pattern: Tribal knowledge only
    remediation: Document all governance policies
  positive:
  - id: GOV-POS-001
    signal: Balanced governance enabling innovation with guardrails
  - id: GOV-POS-002
    signal: Technical enforcement of key policies
  - id: GOV-POS-003
    signal: Regular policy review and optimization
