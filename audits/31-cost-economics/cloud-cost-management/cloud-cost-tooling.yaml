  what: |
    This audit examines the cloud cost management tooling ecosystem
    including evaluation of tool capabilities, coverage, integration,
    and effectiveness. It identifies gaps and optimization opportunities
    in the tooling landscape.
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective tooling is essential for scalable cost management. The
    right tools automate tedious tasks, provide actionable insights,
    and enable proactive optimization. Poor tooling choices waste
    both tool spend and staff time.
  when_to_run:
  - Annual tool assessment
  - When evaluating new tools
  - After tool implementations
  - During FinOps maturity reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TOOL-CRIT-001
    signal: No cost management tools in use
    evidence_pattern: No native or third-party tools
    explanation: |
      Without cost management tools, organizations rely on
      manual bill review, which does not scale and misses
      optimization opportunities.
    remediation: Implement at minimum native cloud cost tools
  high:
  - id: TOOL-HIGH-001
    signal: Tools not covering key capabilities
    evidence_pattern: Major capability gaps
    explanation: |
      Gaps in tool capabilities mean important cost management
      activities cannot be performed effectively.
    remediation: Address capability gaps with appropriate tools
  - id: TOOL-HIGH-002
    signal: Tool features not utilized
    evidence_pattern: Paying for unused capabilities
    explanation: |
      Underutilized tools waste both licensing costs and the
      potential value the tool could provide.
    remediation: Increase adoption or right-size tool licenses
  medium:
  - id: TOOL-MED-001
    signal: Overlapping tool capabilities
    evidence_pattern: Multiple tools doing the same thing
    remediation: Consolidate to reduce tool spend
  - id: TOOL-MED-002
    signal: Tools not integrated with workflows
    evidence_pattern: Tool insights not actioned
    remediation: Integrate tools into operational workflows
  low:
  - id: TOOL-LOW-001
    signal: No tool ROI tracking
    evidence_pattern: Unknown value from tools
    remediation: Track ROI of cost management tools
  positive:
  - id: TOOL-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive tool coverage for requirements
  - id: TOOL-POS-002
    signal: High tool utilization and adoption
  - id: TOOL-POS-003
    signal: Clear tool ROI demonstration
