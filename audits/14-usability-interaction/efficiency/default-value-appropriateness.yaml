  what: |
    This audit examines default values - the pre-populated or pre-selected
    values in forms, settings, and configuration interfaces. It evaluates:

    - Default value selection rationale
    - Alignment with most common user choices
    - Security implications of defaults
    - Privacy implications of defaults
    - Smart defaults based on context
    - Default value discoverability
    - Reset to default functionality
  why_it_matters: |
    Default values significantly impact user behavior and efficiency:
    - Good defaults reduce user effort (fewer changes needed)
    - Bad defaults cause errors and frustration
    - Insecure defaults create vulnerabilities
    - Privacy-invasive defaults erode trust
    - Most users never change defaults (status quo bias)

    Studies show 70-90% of users keep default settings, making
    default selection a critical design decision.

  - Form design review
  - Settings interface audit
  - Privacy and security review
  - Onboarding optimization
  - Conversion rate optimization

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEF-CRIT-001
    signal: Security-sensitive defaults set to insecure values
    evidence_indicators:
    - Passwords pre-filled with weak defaults
    - Security features disabled by default
    - Sensitive data sharing enabled by default
    explanation: |
      Insecure defaults put users at risk, especially since
      most users don't change default settings.
    remediation: Set secure-by-default values for all security settings
  - id: DEF-CRIT-002
    signal: Privacy-invasive options enabled by default
    evidence_indicators:
    - Data collection enabled without consent
    - Sharing options pre-enabled
    - Tracking enabled by default
    explanation: |
      Privacy should be protected by default. Enabling invasive
      options by default violates privacy principles.
    remediation: Default to privacy-protective settings; require opt-in
  high:
  - id: DEF-HIGH-001
    signal: Defaults misaligned with majority user preference
    explanation: |
      When defaults don't match what most users want, the majority
      must take action to change them, wasting effort.
    remediation: Analyze user data; set defaults to most common choices
  - id: DEF-HIGH-002
    signal: Required fields have inappropriate default values
    explanation: |
      Default values in required fields can lead to unintended
      submissions if users don't notice them.
    remediation: Leave required fields empty or use obviously placeholder values
  - id: DEF-HIGH-003
    signal: No way to reset to default values
    explanation: |
      Users who have changed settings need a way to return to
      known-good default states.
    remediation: Provide reset-to-defaults functionality
  medium:
  - id: DEF-MED-001
    signal: Defaults not contextualized to user type or region
    remediation: Implement smart defaults based on user context
  - id: DEF-MED-002
    signal: Default values not clearly distinguishable from user input
    remediation: Visually indicate pre-filled vs user-entered values
  low:
  - id: DEF-LOW-001
    signal: Minor defaults could be improved based on usage data
  positive:
  - id: DEF-POS-001
    signal: Defaults aligned with most common user choices
  - id: DEF-POS-002
    signal: Privacy-protective defaults
  - id: DEF-POS-003
    signal: Smart defaults based on context
