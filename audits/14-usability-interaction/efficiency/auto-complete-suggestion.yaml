  what: |
    This audit examines auto-complete and suggestion features that help
    users complete inputs faster and more accurately. It evaluates:

    - Text field auto-complete functionality
    - Search suggestion quality
    - Recently used and frequently used suggestions
    - Smart defaults and predictions
    - Suggestion relevance and ranking
    - Performance and responsiveness
    - Keyboard navigation of suggestions
    - Mobile-specific considerations
  why_it_matters: |
    Auto-complete and suggestions:
    - Reduce typing effort and time
    - Prevent spelling and input errors
    - Help users discover available options
    - Improve search effectiveness
    - Guide users toward valid inputs
    - Enhance mobile experience (less typing)

    Poor or missing auto-complete can make text-heavy interfaces
    tedious and error-prone.
  when_to_run:
  - Form optimization
  - Search experience review
  - Mobile UX audit
  - Input error analysis
  - Efficiency optimization

signals:
  critical:
  - id: AUTO-CRIT-001
    signal: Auto-complete suggestions not keyboard accessible
    evidence_indicators:
    - Cannot navigate suggestions with arrow keys
    - Cannot select with Enter
    - Screen reader cannot access suggestions
    explanation: |
      Auto-complete must be keyboard accessible for usability
      and accessibility compliance.
    remediation: Implement proper ARIA combobox pattern
  - id: AUTO-CRIT-002
    signal: Auto-complete blocks input until suggestions load
    evidence_indicators:
    - Input field freezes during suggestion fetch
    - User cannot continue typing
    - Long delays before input responds
    explanation: |
      Blocking input while loading suggestions frustrates users
      and defeats the efficiency purpose of auto-complete.
    remediation: Load suggestions asynchronously; allow continued typing
  high:
  - id: AUTO-HIGH-001
    signal: Suggestions irrelevant or poorly ranked
    explanation: |
      Suggestions that don't match user intent waste time
      and erode trust in the feature.
    remediation: Improve suggestion algorithm; use relevance ranking
  - id: AUTO-HIGH-002
    signal: High-value inputs lack auto-complete
    explanation: |
      Fields that would significantly benefit from auto-complete
      (search, addresses, names) should have it implemented.
    remediation: Add auto-complete to high-value text fields
  - id: AUTO-HIGH-003
    signal: Auto-complete suggestions take more than 500ms to appear
    explanation: |
      Slow suggestions feel unresponsive and may arrive after
      the user has already moved on.
    remediation: Optimize suggestion loading; add debouncing
  medium:
  - id: AUTO-MED-001
    signal: No indication that auto-complete is available
    remediation: Add visual hints that suggestions are available
  - id: AUTO-MED-002
    signal: Suggestions don't include recent/frequent items
    remediation: Prioritize recently or frequently used values
  - id: AUTO-MED-003
    signal: Cannot dismiss suggestions easily
    remediation: Allow escape key and click-away to dismiss
  low:
  - id: AUTO-LOW-001
    signal: Suggestion styling inconsistent with design system
  positive:
  - id: AUTO-POS-001
    signal: Fast, relevant auto-complete on appropriate fields
  - id: AUTO-POS-002
    signal: Full keyboard navigation support
  - id: AUTO-POS-003
    signal: Smart suggestions based on user history
