  what: |
    This audit examines batch operation capabilities - the ability to
    perform actions on multiple items simultaneously. It evaluates:

    - Multi-select mechanisms (checkboxes, shift-click, lasso)
    - Bulk action availability and discoverability
    - Selection feedback and state management
    - Batch operation progress and status
    - Error handling for partial failures
    - Undo/rollback for batch operations
    - Performance under large selections
  why_it_matters: |
    Batch operations are critical for:
    - User productivity (avoid repetitive individual actions)
    - Data management tasks (bulk edits, moves, deletes)
    - Administrative workflows
    - Time-sensitive operations
    - Reducing user fatigue and errors

    Without batch support, users waste significant time performing
    repetitive actions that could be done once.
  when_to_run:
  - Data-heavy application review
  - Admin interface audit
  - Productivity optimization
  - User feedback indicates repetitive task frustration

signals:
  critical:
  - id: BATCH-CRIT-001
    signal: No multi-select capability in data-heavy interface
    evidence_indicators:
    - Lists/tables without selection checkboxes
    - Users must perform actions one item at a time
    - Workflows requiring bulk actions are extremely tedious
    explanation: |
      Data-intensive interfaces without multi-select force users
      to perform repetitive actions, wasting significant time.
    remediation: Implement multi-select with bulk action toolbar
  - id: BATCH-CRIT-002
    signal: Batch operation fails silently with no feedback
    evidence_indicators:
    - Actions complete without status indication
    - Partial failures not communicated
    - Users unsure if operation succeeded
    explanation: |
      Batch operations can partially fail. Users need clear
      feedback about what succeeded and what failed.
    remediation: Show progress, success count, and detailed failure info
  high:
  - id: BATCH-HIGH-001
    signal: Destructive batch operations lack confirmation
    explanation: |
      Bulk delete or irreversible actions need confirmation
      to prevent catastrophic mistakes.
    remediation: Add confirmation dialogs for destructive bulk actions
  - id: BATCH-HIGH-002
    signal: No select-all functionality
    explanation: |
      Without select-all, users must manually select every item,
      defeating the purpose of batch operations.
    remediation: Implement select-all with clear indication of scope
  - id: BATCH-HIGH-003
    signal: Selection state lost during navigation or refresh
    explanation: |
      Losing selection forces users to start over, which is
      especially frustrating after careful item selection.
    remediation: Persist selection state across navigation
  medium:
  - id: BATCH-MED-001
    signal: Batch operations not undoable
    remediation: Implement undo for batch operations where feasible
  - id: BATCH-MED-002
    signal: Selection count not visible
    remediation: Display count of selected items
  - id: BATCH-MED-003
    signal: Shift-click and keyboard selection not supported
    remediation: Add standard multi-select patterns (Shift+click, Ctrl+click)
  low:
  - id: BATCH-LOW-001
    signal: Batch action toolbar position inconsistent
  positive:
  - id: BATCH-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive multi-select with bulk action toolbar
  - id: BATCH-POS-002
    signal: Clear progress indication for batch operations
  - id: BATCH-POS-003
    signal: Undo available for batch operations
