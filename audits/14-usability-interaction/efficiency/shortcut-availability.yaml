  what: |
    This audit examines keyboard shortcuts and accelerators - mechanisms
    that allow experienced users to bypass normal navigation paths.
    It evaluates:

    - Keyboard shortcut availability for common actions
    - Discoverability of shortcuts (hints, documentation)
    - Consistency with platform conventions
    - Customization options
    - Conflict detection and handling
    - Accessibility implications
    - Command palettes and quick actions
  why_it_matters: |
    Shortcuts are essential for:
    - Power user efficiency (often 5-10x faster than mouse)
    - Accessibility (keyboard-only users)
    - Repetitive task optimization
    - Professional workflow support
    - User satisfaction (experts expect shortcuts)

    Lack of shortcuts frustrates power users and can be a deal-breaker
    for professional applications where efficiency matters.
  when_to_run:
  - Power user experience review
  - Accessibility audit
  - Productivity optimization
  - Professional tool assessment
  - Keyboard navigation testing

signals:
  critical:
  - id: SHORT-CRIT-001
    signal: Shortcuts override critical system/browser shortcuts
    evidence_indicators:
    - Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, or Ctrl+Z don't work as expected
    - Browser shortcuts (Ctrl+T, Ctrl+W) intercepted
    - Accessibility shortcuts blocked
    explanation: |
      Overriding system shortcuts breaks user expectations and can
      trap users in the application, creating accessibility issues.
    remediation: Never override standard system shortcuts; use application-specific keys
  - id: SHORT-CRIT-002
    signal: No keyboard shortcuts available for any actions
    evidence_indicators:
    - All actions require mouse interaction
    - Keyboard-only navigation impossible
    - No shortcut documentation exists
    explanation: |
      Lack of any shortcuts severely impacts accessibility and
      power user efficiency.
    remediation: Implement shortcuts for at least the most common actions
  high:
  - id: SHORT-HIGH-001
    signal: Shortcuts not discoverable (no hints, documentation, or menu display)
    explanation: |
      Undiscoverable shortcuts might as well not exist. Users need
      to learn shortcuts exist before they can use them.
    remediation: Show shortcuts in menus, tooltips, and provide documentation
  - id: SHORT-HIGH-002
    signal: Frequent actions lack shortcuts
    explanation: |
      The most commonly used actions should have shortcuts to
      support power user efficiency.
    remediation: Add shortcuts for top 10 most frequent actions
  - id: SHORT-HIGH-003
    signal: Shortcuts inconsistent with platform conventions
    explanation: |
      Users expect shortcuts to follow platform conventions.
      Non-standard shortcuts cause confusion and errors.
    remediation: Align shortcuts with platform standards (Cmd on Mac, Ctrl on Windows)
  medium:
  - id: SHORT-MED-001
    signal: No command palette or quick action search
    remediation: Implement command palette for action discovery and execution
  - id: SHORT-MED-002
    signal: Shortcuts not customizable
    remediation: Allow users to customize shortcuts to their preferences
  - id: SHORT-MED-003
    signal: Shortcut conflicts between features
    remediation: Audit and resolve conflicting shortcuts
  low:
  - id: SHORT-LOW-001
    signal: Shortcuts use obscure or hard-to-remember key combinations
  positive:
  - id: SHORT-POS-001
    signal: Comprehensive shortcuts for all common actions
  - id: SHORT-POS-002
    signal: Shortcuts visible in menus and tooltips
  - id: SHORT-POS-003
    signal: Command palette for action discovery
