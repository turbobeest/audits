  what: |
    This audit evaluates how well the interface is optimized for actions
    and workflows that users perform most frequently. It examines:

    - Identification of most frequent user actions
    - Accessibility of high-frequency actions
    - Quick access features (favorites, recent, pinned)
    - Workflow automation and templates
    - Repeat action optimization
    - Personalization based on usage patterns
    - Power user features for frequent tasks

  why_it_matters: |
    Frequent action optimization directly impacts:
    - Daily user productivity
    - User satisfaction with the product
    - Perceived application quality
    - Competitive advantage
    - Long-term user retention

    Even small efficiency improvements compound dramatically for
    actions performed many times per day.

    - "Productivity optimization initiatives"
    - "Power user experience review"
    - "Usage analytics review"

signals:
  critical:
    - id: "FAQ-CRIT-001"
      signal: "Top 5 frequent actions require excessive steps or time"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Most common actions take 5+ steps"
        - "Daily tasks require significant repetitive effort"
        - "Users create external workarounds"
      explanation: |
        When the most common actions are inefficient, users waste
        significant time daily, and productivity suffers.
      remediation: "Prioritize streamlining top frequent actions"

    - id: "FAQ-CRIT-002"
      signal: "No personalization or quick access for frequent actions"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "No favorites or pinning"
        - "No recent items feature"
        - "No customizable quick access"
      explanation: |
        Without personalization features, every user must navigate
        from scratch regardless of their patterns.
      remediation: "Implement favorites, recent items, and quick access"

  high:
    - id: "FAQ-HIGH-001"
      signal: "Repetitive workflows lack templates or automation"
      explanation: |
        Workflows performed repeatedly with similar parameters
        should offer templates or automation.
      remediation: "Add templates or saved configurations for common workflows"

    - id: "FAQ-HIGH-002"
      signal: "No 'repeat last action' functionality"
      explanation: |
        Many tasks involve repeating the same action. Quick repeat
        can dramatically improve efficiency.
      remediation: "Implement repeat last action for applicable features"

    - id: "FAQ-HIGH-003"
      signal: "Interface doesn't adapt to user's usage patterns"
      explanation: |
        Static interfaces treat all users the same, missing
        opportunities for usage-based optimization.
      remediation: "Implement adaptive features based on usage patterns"
