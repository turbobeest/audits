  what: |
    This audit measures the click/tap depth - the number of discrete
    interactions required to navigate to features or complete tasks.
    It evaluates:

    - Clicks/taps to reach key features from home/landing
    - Depth of navigation hierarchy
    - Interaction count for common workflows
    - Mobile vs desktop interaction differences
    - Unnecessary intermediate steps
    - Opportunities for depth reduction
  why_it_matters: |
    Click depth directly impacts:
    - User efficiency and productivity
    - Task abandonment rates (each click is an exit opportunity)
    - Mobile usability (taps are more costly than clicks)
    - User perception of interface complexity
    - Accessibility (more interactions = more challenges)

    The "three-click rule" (while debated) reflects the truth that
    excessive depth frustrates users and reduces engagement.
  when_to_run:
  - Information architecture review
  - Navigation redesign
  - Mobile optimization
  - User complaints about finding features
  - Efficiency optimization

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEPTH-CRIT-001
    signal: Frequently used feature requires more than 5 clicks to access
    evidence_indicators:
    - Core features buried deep in navigation
    - Users creating workarounds (bookmarks, shortcuts)
    - High feature abandonment
    explanation: |
      Frequently used features should be readily accessible.
      Deep burial of common features wastes user time and
      indicates poor information architecture.
    remediation: Surface frequently used features; add shortcuts or quick access
  high:
  - id: DEPTH-HIGH-001
    signal: Average navigation depth exceeds 4 levels
    explanation: |
      Deep hierarchies are hard to navigate and understand.
      Users lose context and struggle to find their way.
    remediation: Flatten hierarchy; use better categorization
  - id: DEPTH-HIGH-002
    signal: Mobile requires significantly more taps than desktop clicks
    explanation: |
      Mobile interactions should be optimized for touch, not just
      translated from desktop. Excess taps are frustrating.
    remediation: Design mobile-specific navigation; reduce tap requirements
  - id: DEPTH-HIGH-003
    signal: Multiple intermediate pages with no content value
    explanation: |
      Intermediate pages that only serve as navigation add
      friction without adding value.
    remediation: Eliminate hub pages; use megamenus or direct links
  medium:
  - id: DEPTH-MED-001
    signal: Related features at inconsistent depths
    remediation: Standardize feature accessibility across categories
  - id: DEPTH-MED-002
    signal: No shortcuts for expert users to bypass navigation
    remediation: Add keyboard shortcuts, search, or quick access features
  low:
  - id: DEPTH-LOW-001
    signal: Minor depth inconsistencies in similar features
  positive:
  - id: DEPTH-POS-001
    signal: Core features accessible in 1-2 clicks
  - id: DEPTH-POS-002
    signal: Flat navigation structure with clear categorization
  - id: DEPTH-POS-003
    signal: Shortcuts available for frequent actions
