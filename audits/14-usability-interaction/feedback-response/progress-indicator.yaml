  what: |
    This audit examines progress indicators for operations that take
    significant time. It evaluates:

    - Determinate vs indeterminate progress indicators
    - Progress bar accuracy and honesty
    - Multi-step wizard progress indication
    - Upload/download progress
    - Background task progress
    - Time remaining estimates
    - Cancellation options during progress
  why_it_matters: |
    Progress indicators are essential for:
    - Managing user expectations during waits
    - Providing sense of control and predictability
    - Reducing perceived wait time
    - Preventing task abandonment
    - Enabling informed decisions about waiting

    Research shows perceived wait time decreases significantly with
    progress indication, even if actual time remains the same.
  when_to_run:
  - Long-running operation review
  - Multi-step flow design
  - Upload/download feature audit
  - User complaints about wait times
  - Onboarding flow review

  - Full application access
  - Ability to trigger long operations
  - Network throttling for upload/download testing

signals:
  critical:
  - id: PROG-CRIT-001
    signal: Long operations (>10s) have no progress indication
    evidence_indicators:
    - Operations take minutes with only spinner
    - Users cannot tell if operation is progressing
    - No way to know how much longer to wait
    explanation: |
      For long operations, indeterminate indicators (spinners) are
      inadequate. Users need to know progress is being made.
    remediation: Add determinate progress indicators for predictable operations
  - id: PROG-CRIT-002
    signal: Progress indicator stuck or frozen
    evidence_indicators:
    - Progress bar stops moving
    - Percentage doesn't update
    - Users believe operation has failed
    explanation: |
      Frozen progress indicators are worse than none - they make
      the system appear broken.
    remediation: Ensure progress updates continuously; show activity indicators
  high:
  - id: PROG-HIGH-001
    signal: Progress jumps backwards or restarts
    explanation: |
      Progress going backwards destroys user trust and creates
      confusion about actual progress.
    remediation: Ensure progress only increases; adjust estimation methods
  - id: PROG-HIGH-002
    signal: Progress stuck at 99% for extended time
    explanation: |
      The perception of "almost done" followed by long waits is
      particularly frustrating for users.
    remediation: Improve progress estimation; consider two-phase indication
  - id: PROG-HIGH-003
    signal: Multi-step process lacks step indication
    explanation: |
      Users in multi-step flows need to know their position and
      how much remains.
    remediation: Add step indicator showing current and total steps
  medium:
  - id: PROG-MED-001
    signal: Time estimates wildly inaccurate
    remediation: Improve estimation algorithm; consider showing ranges
  - id: PROG-MED-002
    signal: No cancel option for long operations
    remediation: Provide cancel/abort option for operations >10 seconds
  - id: PROG-MED-003
    signal: Progress not accessible to screen readers
    remediation: Announce progress updates for assistive technology
  low:
  - id: PROG-LOW-001
    signal: Progress animation could be smoother
  positive:
  - id: PROG-POS-001
    signal: Accurate, honest progress indication
  - id: PROG-POS-002
    signal: Clear step indication in multi-step flows
  - id: PROG-POS-003
    signal: Useful time remaining estimates
