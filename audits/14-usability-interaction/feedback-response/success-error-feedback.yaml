  what: |
    This audit examines how success and error outcomes are communicated
    to users. It evaluates:

    - Success confirmation messages and indicators
    - Error message clarity and helpfulness
    - Error message positioning and visibility
    - Recovery guidance in error states
    - Inline vs global feedback patterns
    - Feedback timing and persistence
    - Accessibility of feedback messages
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective outcome feedback:
    - Confirms user actions succeeded
    - Enables error recovery through clear guidance
    - Reduces user anxiety and uncertainty
    - Prevents repeated attempts due to unclear outcomes
    - Builds trust through transparent communication

    Poor feedback leaves users uncertain, frustrated, and unable
    to recover from errors.
  when_to_run:
  - Error handling review
  - Form usability audit
  - User feedback indicates confusion
  - New feature implementation
  - Accessibility compliance audit

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FEEDBACK-CRIT-001
    signal: Errors fail silently with no user notification
    evidence_indicators:
    - Operations fail without any feedback
    - Users believe actions succeeded when they failed
    - Data loss occurs due to unnoticed failures
    explanation: |
      Silent failures are one of the worst UX problems. Users
      cannot recover from errors they don't know about.
    remediation: Add clear error feedback for all failure scenarios
  - id: FEEDBACK-CRIT-002
    signal: Error messages use technical jargon users can't understand
    evidence_indicators:
    - Error codes displayed without explanation
    - Technical stack traces shown to users
    - Messages assume technical knowledge
    explanation: |
      Technical error messages fail their purpose - users cannot
      understand or act on them.
    remediation: Translate errors to user-friendly language; provide guidance
  high:
  - id: FEEDBACK-HIGH-001
    signal: Error messages don't explain how to fix the problem
    explanation: |
      Error messages should guide recovery, not just announce failure.
      Users need to know what to do next.
    remediation: Include specific recovery instructions in error messages
  - id: FEEDBACK-HIGH-002
    signal: Success feedback missing for important actions
    explanation: |
      Critical actions (save, submit, purchase) need explicit confirmation
      so users know their action succeeded.
    remediation: Add success confirmation for all important operations
  - id: FEEDBACK-HIGH-003
    signal: Error messages not associated with relevant fields
    explanation: |
      For form errors, messages should appear near the problematic
      field, not just in a generic location.
    remediation: Position errors inline with relevant inputs
  medium:
  - id: FEEDBACK-MED-001
    signal: Feedback messages disappear too quickly
    remediation: Show feedback for minimum 4 seconds; allow dismissal
  - id: FEEDBACK-MED-002
    signal: Success and error messages visually similar
    remediation: Use distinct colors and icons for different feedback types
  - id: FEEDBACK-MED-003
    signal: Multiple errors shown without prioritization
    remediation: Prioritize errors; focus attention on first/most critical
  low:
  - id: FEEDBACK-LOW-001
    signal: Feedback tone could be more encouraging
  positive:
  - id: FEEDBACK-POS-001
    signal: Clear, actionable error messages
  - id: FEEDBACK-POS-002
    signal: Consistent feedback patterns throughout
  - id: FEEDBACK-POS-003
    signal: Accessible feedback announcements
