  what: |
    This audit examines how loading states are communicated to users
    during asynchronous operations. It evaluates:

    - Loading indicator presence and design
    - Spinner, skeleton, and shimmer patterns
    - Perceived performance optimization
    - Timeout handling
    - Loading state accessibility
    - Placeholder content strategies
    - Loading state consistency
  why_it_matters: |
    Loading states are critical for:
    - Preventing perceived unresponsiveness
    - Managing user expectations
    - Reducing abandonment during waits
    - Creating perception of faster performance
    - Maintaining user confidence

    Poor loading state handling leads to user frustration, repeated
    actions, and the perception that the application is broken.
  when_to_run:
  - Performance perception review
  - New feature implementation
  - User complaints about slowness
  - Async operation audit
  - Accessibility review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: LOAD-CRIT-001
    signal: No loading indicator for operations >1 second
    evidence_indicators:
    - UI appears frozen during data fetch
    - Users cannot tell if action is processing
    - Blank screens during loading
    explanation: |
      Operations taking more than 1 second need loading feedback.
      Without it, users assume the system is broken.
    remediation: Add loading indicators for all async operations >100ms
  - id: LOAD-CRIT-002
    signal: Loading state blocks entire application
    evidence_indicators:
    - Full-page overlay for small data loads
    - Users cannot interact with any part of UI
    - Navigation blocked during partial loads
    explanation: |
      Blocking the entire UI for partial loads frustrates users
      who could be doing other things.
    remediation: Use component-level loading; keep UI interactive
  high:
  - id: LOAD-HIGH-001
    signal: Loading indicators not accessible to screen readers
    explanation: |
      Screen reader users need loading state announced to know
      when to wait and when content is ready.
    remediation: Use aria-live regions; announce loading states
  - id: LOAD-HIGH-002
    signal: Indefinite loading with no timeout handling
    explanation: |
      Loading that spins forever without timeout gives users
      no recourse when operations fail silently.
    remediation: Implement timeouts; show error states for failed loads
  - id: LOAD-HIGH-003
    signal: Content layout shift when loading completes
    explanation: |
      Content jumping around after loading is disorienting and
      can cause users to click wrong elements.
    remediation: Use skeleton loaders matching final layout; reserve space
  medium:
  - id: LOAD-MED-001
    signal: Generic spinners instead of meaningful skeletons
    remediation: Use skeleton loaders that preview content structure
  - id: LOAD-MED-002
    signal: Loading indicators inconsistent across application
    remediation: Standardize loading patterns and components
  - id: LOAD-MED-003
    signal: No loading state for background refreshes
    remediation: Show subtle indicators for background data updates
  low:
  - id: LOAD-LOW-001
    signal: Loading animation could be smoother or more polished
  positive:
  - id: LOAD-POS-001
    signal: Appropriate skeleton loaders for all content
  - id: LOAD-POS-002
    signal: Component-level loading states
  - id: LOAD-POS-003
    signal: Accessible loading announcements
