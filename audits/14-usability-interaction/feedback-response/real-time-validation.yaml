  what: |
    This audit examines real-time (inline) validation of user inputs that
    provides immediate feedback as users complete forms. It evaluates:

    - Validation timing (on blur, on change, on submit)
    - Inline error message display
    - Positive validation feedback
    - Input format guidance
    - Password strength indicators
    - Username/email availability checks
    - Validation accessibility
    - Performance of async validation
  why_it_matters: |
    Real-time validation significantly improves form completion:
    - Prevents users from proceeding with invalid data
    - Reduces submission errors and re-entry
    - Provides immediate learning about requirements
    - Decreases form abandonment
    - Improves perceived form usability

    Poor validation leads to frustration, submission errors, and
    users abandoning forms entirely.
  when_to_run:
  - Form usability audit
  - Sign-up flow optimization
  - Error prevention review
  - Accessibility audit
  - User feedback on forms

signals:
  critical:
  - id: VALID-CRIT-001
    signal: Validation errors only shown after submission
    evidence_indicators:
    - No inline validation as user types
    - All errors shown at top after submit
    - Users must scroll to find problematic field
    explanation: |
      Waiting until submission to show errors wastes user time
      and creates a frustrating submit-correct-resubmit cycle.
    remediation: Add inline validation on blur or change for all fields
  - id: VALID-CRIT-002
    signal: Validation errors not associated with fields
    evidence_indicators:
    - Generic error message at top of form
    - No indication which field has error
    - User must guess what's wrong
    explanation: |
      Errors must be clearly associated with the problematic field
      so users know exactly what to fix.
    remediation: Display errors inline adjacent to the relevant field
  high:
  - id: VALID-HIGH-001
    signal: Validation too aggressive (validates on every keystroke)
    explanation: |
      Showing errors immediately on each keystroke is annoying
      and distracting, especially for complex fields.
    remediation: Validate on blur or after pause in typing
  - id: VALID-HIGH-002
    signal: Valid input not positively confirmed
    explanation: |
      Users benefit from knowing their input is correct, not
      just being told when it's wrong.
    remediation: Show positive validation indicators (checkmark, green)
  - id: VALID-HIGH-003
    signal: Error messages don't explain how to fix the problem
    explanation: |
      "Invalid input" doesn't help users fix the problem.
      Messages should explain the requirement.
    remediation: Provide specific guidance on valid formats and requirements
  medium:
  - id: VALID-MED-001
    signal: Validation not accessible to screen readers
    remediation: Use aria-describedby and aria-invalid appropriately
  - id: VALID-MED-002
    signal: Async validation (username check) has no loading state
    remediation: Show loading indicator during async validation
  - id: VALID-MED-003
    signal: Validation timing inconsistent across fields
    remediation: Standardize validation behavior across the form
  low:
  - id: VALID-LOW-001
    signal: Error message styling could be more prominent
  positive:
  - id: VALID-POS-001
    signal: Appropriate inline validation on all fields
  - id: VALID-POS-002
    signal: Clear, helpful error messages
  - id: VALID-POS-003
    signal: Positive feedback for valid input
