  what: |
    This audit evaluates the consistency of user experience across
    different platforms (web, mobile web, native mobile, desktop) where
    the application is available. It examines feature parity, interaction
    patterns, visual design, and terminology to ensure users have a
    coherent experience regardless of platform.
  why_it_matters: |
    Users increasingly switch between devices and expect a consistent
    experience. Inconsistencies between platforms cause confusion, force
    users to relearn the interface, and create perception of lower quality.
    While platforms have native conventions that should be respected,
    the core experience should remain recognizable and consistent.
  when_to_run:
  - When launching on a new platform
  - During multi-platform feature development
  - When users report platform-specific confusion
  - During periodic cross-platform audits

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CROSSPLAT-CRIT-001
    signal: Core feature missing on one platform
    evidence_indicators:
    - Feature available on web but not mobile
    - Critical functionality platform-exclusive
    - User blocked from task on certain platforms
    explanation: |
      Users expect to accomplish the same tasks regardless of platform.
      Missing core features force users to switch devices unnecessarily.
    remediation: Prioritize feature parity for core functionality
  high:
  - id: CROSSPLAT-HIGH-001
    signal: Same feature works fundamentally differently across platforms
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different workflow for same task
    - Different data shown for same view
    - Different permissions or capabilities
    explanation: |
      Fundamental differences in how features work cause confusion
      when users switch platforms.
    remediation: Align core workflows while adapting to platform conventions
  - id: CROSSPLAT-HIGH-002
    signal: Terminology differs between platforms
    evidence_indicators:
    - Web says 'Delete', mobile says 'Remove'
    - Entity names differ between platforms
    - Menu items named differently
    explanation: |
      Users cannot transfer knowledge between platforms when
      terminology differs.
    remediation: Use consistent terminology across all platforms
  - id: CROSSPLAT-HIGH-003
    signal: Navigation structure significantly different
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different menu hierarchy on mobile vs web
    - Features in different locations
    - Cannot find familiar features on new platform
    explanation: |
      Users familiar with one platform cannot navigate the other
      when structure differs significantly.
    remediation: Maintain consistent information architecture with platform-appropriate navigation
  medium:
  - id: CROSSPLAT-MED-001
    signal: Visual identity inconsistent across platforms
    evidence_indicators:
    - Different color schemes
    - Different iconography
    - Branding elements vary
    remediation: Align visual identity while respecting platform conventions
  - id: CROSSPLAT-MED-002
    signal: Data sync gaps between platforms
    evidence_indicators:
    - Changes on one platform slow to appear on another
    - Offline data handling differs
    remediation: Ensure real-time or near-real-time sync across platforms
  - id: CROSSPLAT-MED-003
    signal: Settings/preferences don't sync
    evidence_pattern: User settings platform-specific rather than account-wide
    remediation: Sync user preferences across platforms where appropriate
  low:
  - id: CROSSPLAT-LOW-001
    signal: Minor interaction differences not justified by platform
    remediation: Align interactions where platform doesn't mandate difference
  - id: CROSSPLAT-LOW-002
    signal: Help content platform-specific when it could be shared
    remediation: Create shared help content with platform-specific sections
  positive:
  - id: CROSSPLAT-POS-001
    signal: Core features available on all platforms
  - id: CROSSPLAT-POS-002
    signal: Consistent terminology across platforms
  - id: CROSSPLAT-POS-003
    signal: Visual identity recognizable on all platforms
  - id: CROSSPLAT-POS-004
    signal: Platform conventions respected while maintaining consistency
