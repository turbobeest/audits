  what: |
    This audit evaluates the consistency of interaction patterns across
    the application. It examines how users perform common actions like
    navigation, editing, deleting, filtering, and sorting to ensure
    similar tasks are accomplished in similar ways throughout the interface.
  why_it_matters: |
    Consistent interaction patterns reduce learning time and cognitive
    load. When similar actions work the same way across an application,
    users can transfer their knowledge from one area to another. Jakob
    Nielsen identified consistency as a fundamental usability heuristic.
    Inconsistent patterns force users to relearn the interface for each
    new screen.
  when_to_run:
  - During usability audits
  - When users report confusion about how to perform actions
  - After major feature additions
  - During design system development

signals:
  critical:
  - id: INTERACT-CRIT-001
    signal: Destructive actions have inconsistent confirmation patterns
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some deletes require confirmation, others don't
    - Different confirmation UIs (modal, inline, toast)
    - Some destructive actions are undoable, others aren't
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent destructive action handling leads to accidental
      data loss when users expect confirmation but don't get it.
    remediation: Standardize confirmation pattern for all destructive actions
  high:
  - id: INTERACT-HIGH-001
    signal: Navigation patterns vary across the application
    evidence_indicators:
    - Breadcrumbs in some areas, not others
    - Back button behavior differs between sections
    - Tab navigation vs sidebar differs inconsistently
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent navigation forces users to relearn how to
      move around the application for each new section.
    remediation: Standardize navigation patterns across all sections
  - id: INTERACT-HIGH-002
    signal: Edit patterns differ between similar items
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some items use inline editing, others use modals
    - Edit access via different affordances (icon, double-click, menu)
    - Save patterns differ (auto-save vs explicit save)
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent edit patterns increase errors and slow users
      as they figure out how editing works in each context.
    remediation: Define and apply consistent edit pattern for similar item types
  - id: INTERACT-HIGH-003
    signal: Action feedback inconsistent
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some actions show loading state, others don't
    - Success/error feedback varies (toast, inline, modal)
    - Some actions have optimistic UI, others wait for server
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent feedback leaves users uncertain about whether
      their actions succeeded.
    remediation: Implement consistent feedback pattern for all actions
  medium:
  - id: INTERACT-MED-001
    signal: Filter/sort patterns inconsistent across lists
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some lists have filter bar, others have dropdown
    - Sort order indicators differ
    - Clear filter mechanism varies
    remediation: Standardize filter/sort UI patterns for all lists
  - id: INTERACT-MED-002
    signal: Selection patterns vary
    evidence_indicators:
    - Some lists use checkboxes, others use highlight
    - Multi-select works differently across views
    - Selection action menus appear in different places
    remediation: Define consistent selection pattern based on context
  - id: INTERACT-MED-003
    signal: Overflow menu placement varies
    evidence_indicators:
    - Three-dot menu sometimes right, sometimes left
    - Overflow in row vs overflow in header
    remediation: Standardize overflow menu positioning
  low:
  - id: INTERACT-LOW-001
    signal: Keyboard shortcuts inconsistent
    remediation: Document and standardize keyboard shortcuts
  - id: INTERACT-LOW-002
    signal: Hover states vary across similar elements
    remediation: Standardize hover feedback for interactive elements
  positive:
  - id: INTERACT-POS-001
    signal: Consistent delete confirmation across application
  - id: INTERACT-POS-002
    signal: Unified edit pattern for similar items
  - id: INTERACT-POS-003
    signal: Consistent action feedback patterns
  - id: INTERACT-POS-004
    signal: Navigation patterns uniform throughout
