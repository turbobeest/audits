  what: |
    This audit evaluates the consistency of terminology used in the
    application interface. It examines labels, button text, menu items,
    error messages, and help text to ensure the same concepts are always
    referred to with the same terms and that language is clear and consistent.
  why_it_matters: |
    Inconsistent terminology confuses users and increases cognitive load.
    When the same concept is called different things in different places
    (e.g., "Delete" vs "Remove" vs "Trash"), users must expend effort
    understanding whether these are the same or different actions.
    Consistent terminology is especially important for accessibility and
    internationalization.
  when_to_run:
  - During content/copy audits
  - When preparing for localization
  - After multiple teams contribute to the UI
  - When users report confusion about features

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TERM-CRIT-001
    signal: Same concept uses different terms inconsistently
    evidence_indicators:
    - Delete button in one place, Remove in another for same action
    - User vs Account vs Profile used interchangeably
    - Settings vs Preferences vs Options inconsistently
    explanation: |
      Users cannot know if "Delete" and "Remove" are the same or
      different actions, causing hesitation and errors.
    remediation: Establish and enforce a terminology glossary
  high:
  - id: TERM-HIGH-001
    signal: Action verbs inconsistent across similar buttons
    evidence_pattern: Save vs Submit vs Confirm for form submission
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent action verbs make it unclear what will happen
      when users click buttons.
    remediation: 'Standardize action verbs: Save for data, Submit for forms, Confirm for acknowledgment'
  - id: TERM-HIGH-002
    signal: Entity names vary across the application
    evidence_indicators:
    - Item vs Entry vs Record for same data type
    - Workspace vs Project vs Space used interchangeably
    explanation: |
      Users cannot build a mental model when the same thing has
      different names in different contexts.
    remediation: Define canonical names for all entities and use consistently
  - id: TERM-HIGH-003
    signal: Technical jargon used in user-facing text
    evidence_indicators:
    - Error messages with HTTP codes or database terms
    - Technical terms without explanation
    - Internal naming conventions exposed to users
    explanation: |
      Technical jargon alienates non-technical users and
      creates confusion.
    remediation: Replace technical terms with user-friendly language
  medium:
  - id: TERM-MED-001
    signal: Abbreviations used inconsistently
    evidence_indicators:
    - Org vs Organization mixed
    - App vs Application varies
    remediation: Define when abbreviations are acceptable and use consistently
  - id: TERM-MED-002
    signal: Button labels vary in grammatical form
    evidence_indicators:
    - Mix of 'Save Changes' and 'Saving'
    - Mix of verbs ('Delete') and verb phrases ('Delete Item')
    remediation: Standardize on verb or verb+object pattern for all buttons
  - id: TERM-MED-003
    signal: Help text uses different terms than the UI
    evidence_pattern: Documentation says 'Click Remove' but button says 'Delete'
    remediation: Ensure help text matches actual UI labels exactly
  low:
  - id: TERM-LOW-001
    signal: Minor capitalization inconsistencies
    remediation: Standardize on sentence case or title case
  - id: TERM-LOW-002
    signal: Placeholder text style varies
    remediation: Standardize placeholder text format
  positive:
  - id: TERM-POS-001
    signal: Terminology glossary exists and is followed
  - id: TERM-POS-002
    signal: Entity names consistent throughout application
  - id: TERM-POS-003
    signal: Action verbs used consistently
  - id: TERM-POS-004
