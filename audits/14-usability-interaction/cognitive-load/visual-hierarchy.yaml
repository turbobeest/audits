  what: |
    This audit evaluates the visual hierarchy used to guide user
    attention and convey information importance. It examines use of
    size, color, contrast, whitespace, position, and typography to
    create clear primary/secondary/tertiary levels of importance.
  why_it_matters: |
    Visual hierarchy is fundamental to usability. Without clear hierarchy,
    users must process all elements equally, increasing cognitive load and
    time to find important information. Effective hierarchy guides users
    through content in order of importance and supports efficient scanning.
  when_to_run:
  - During UI design review
  - When users report difficulty finding information
  - During landing page optimization
  - When designing new screens or features

signals:
  critical:
  - id: HIERARCHY-CRIT-001
    signal: No discernible visual hierarchy
    evidence_indicators:
    - All text same size and weight
    - No distinction between headers and body
    - Primary actions not visually emphasized
    explanation: |
      Without hierarchy, users must process everything equally,
      dramatically increasing cognitive load and time to complete tasks.
    remediation: Establish clear hierarchy using size, weight, color, and position
  high:
  - id: HIERARCHY-HIGH-001
    signal: Primary call-to-action not visually prominent
    evidence_pattern: CTA same visual weight as secondary actions
    explanation: |
      Users should immediately see the primary action. When CTAs
      don't stand out, conversion suffers.
    remediation: Make primary CTA visually dominant through size, color, and position
  - id: HIERARCHY-HIGH-002
    signal: Heading levels used inconsistently
    evidence_indicators:
    - H1 used multiple times
    - Heading levels skipped
    - Visual style doesn't match semantic level
    explanation: |
      Inconsistent headings confuse both users and screen readers,
      breaking the expected information hierarchy.
    remediation: Use heading levels semantically; ensure visual style matches importance
  - id: HIERARCHY-HIGH-003
    signal: Critical information lacks visual emphasis
    evidence_pattern: Important content styled like surrounding content
    explanation: |
      Critical information should stand out. If it blends in,
      users may miss it entirely.
    remediation: Use size, color, position, or containers to emphasize critical content
  medium:
  - id: HIERARCHY-MED-001
    signal: Type scale has too many sizes
    evidence_pattern: '>8 distinct font sizes in use'
    remediation: Consolidate to a limited type scale (5-7 sizes)
  - id: HIERARCHY-MED-002
    signal: Color used inconsistently for emphasis
    evidence_pattern: Same accent color for different importance levels
    remediation: Reserve colors for specific hierarchy levels
  - id: HIERARCHY-MED-003
    signal: Whitespace doesn't support grouping
    evidence_pattern: Equal spacing between related and unrelated elements
    remediation: Use proximity to group related items; separate unrelated ones
  low:
  - id: HIERARCHY-LOW-001
    signal: Hierarchy could be stronger
    remediation: Increase contrast between hierarchy levels
  - id: HIERARCHY-LOW-002
    signal: Line height doesn't differentiate content types
    remediation: Use tighter line height for headings, looser for body
  positive:
  - id: HIERARCHY-POS-001
    signal: Clear primary/secondary/tertiary hierarchy
  - id: HIERARCHY-POS-002
    signal: Primary CTA visually dominant
  - id: HIERARCHY-POS-003
    signal: Consistent heading levels throughout
  - id: HIERARCHY-POS-004
    signal: Whitespace effectively groups related content
