  what: |
    This audit evaluates how effectively the interface manages user
    attention. It examines notification systems, animations, interruptions,
    focus states, and distracting elements to ensure attention is directed
    to important information while minimizing disruptive distractions.
  why_it_matters: |
    Human attention is a limited resource. Interfaces that compete for
    attention through excessive notifications, animations, or visual
    noise reduce user effectiveness. Conversely, interfaces that fail
    to draw attention to important information cause users to miss
    critical updates. Effective attention management balances these needs.
  when_to_run:
  - During notification system design
  - When users report missing important updates
  - When users report feeling overwhelmed
  - During animation and transition design

signals:
  critical:
  - id: ATTENTION-CRIT-001
    signal: Critical information presented without attention cue
    evidence_indicators:
    - Error messages same styling as regular content
    - Security warnings not visually prominent
    - Data loss warnings easy to miss
    explanation: |
      Critical information that doesn't grab attention may be
      missed, leading to data loss, security issues, or errors.
    remediation: Use color, iconography, position, and motion to highlight critical info
  - id: ATTENTION-CRIT-002
    signal: Excessive notifications overwhelming users
    evidence_indicators:
    - Multiple simultaneous notifications
    - Frequent interruptive alerts
    - Non-dismissible notifications blocking workflow
    explanation: |
      Notification overload causes users to ignore all notifications,
      including critical ones (cry wolf effect).
    remediation: Consolidate notifications; limit interruptions; prioritize by importance
  high:
  - id: ATTENTION-HIGH-001
    signal: Distracting animations during focused tasks
    evidence_pattern: Looping animations in work areas
    explanation: |
      Movement attracts attention involuntarily. Animations
      during focused work are distracting.
    remediation: Limit animations in work areas; use reduce-motion preference
  - id: ATTENTION-HIGH-002
    signal: No visual hierarchy for notification importance
    evidence_pattern: All notifications styled identically
    explanation: |
      Users cannot quickly assess importance if all notifications
      look the same.
    remediation: Differentiate notification types visually (info, warning, error)
  - id: ATTENTION-HIGH-003
    signal: Important updates appear and disappear too quickly
    evidence_pattern: Auto-dismiss on critical notifications <5 seconds
    explanation: |
      Users may miss important information if it disappears
      before they notice or read it.
    remediation: Persist critical notifications until dismissed; increase auto-dismiss time
  medium:
  - id: ATTENTION-MED-001
    signal: No reduce-motion support
    evidence_pattern: Animations ignore prefers-reduced-motion
    remediation: Respect prefers-reduced-motion media query
  - id: ATTENTION-MED-002
    signal: Focus indicators not visible enough
    evidence_pattern: Subtle or missing focus states
    remediation: Make focus indicators clearly visible (WCAG 2.4.7)
  - id: ATTENTION-MED-003
    signal: No notification center for missed items
    evidence_pattern: Transient notifications with no history
    remediation: Provide notification center to review missed items
  low:
  - id: ATTENTION-LOW-001
    signal: Animations could be more purposeful
    remediation: Use motion to convey meaning, not just decoration
  - id: ATTENTION-LOW-002
    signal: Notification sound/vibration not configurable
    remediation: Allow users to configure notification intensity
  positive:
  - id: ATTENTION-POS-001
    signal: Notification importance clearly differentiated
  - id: ATTENTION-POS-002
    signal: Reduce-motion preference respected
  - id: ATTENTION-POS-003
    signal: Critical notifications persist until acknowledged
  - id: ATTENTION-POS-004
    signal: Animation supports UX without distraction
