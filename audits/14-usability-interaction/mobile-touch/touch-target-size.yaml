  what: |
    This audit evaluates whether interactive elements (buttons, links,
    form controls) meet minimum touch target size requirements. It
    examines element dimensions, spacing between targets, and
    accessibility compliance for touch interfaces.
  why_it_matters: |
    Small touch targets cause tap errors, frustration, and accessibility
    barriers. Research shows the average adult finger pad is about 10mm
    (40px), and targets below this size significantly increase error rates.
    WCAG 2.2 requires 24x24px minimum with 44x44px recommended. Mobile-first
    design demands adequate touch targets.
  when_to_run:
  - During mobile optimization
  - When users report difficulty tapping elements
  - During accessibility audits
  - When reviewing mobile UI components

signals:
  critical:
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-CRIT-001
    signal: Interactive element smaller than 24x24px
    evidence_pattern: Buttons, links, or controls with dimensions <24px
    explanation: |
      WCAG 2.2 Level AA (2.5.8) requires minimum 24x24px touch targets.
      Smaller targets fail accessibility requirements and cause
      significant usability issues.
    remediation: Increase element size to at least 24x24px, preferably 44x44px
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-CRIT-002
    signal: Icon-only button with no touch padding
    evidence_pattern: Small icon used as button without expanded touch area
    explanation: |
      Icons are often 16-24px but the touch target should be larger.
      The visual element can be small while the touch area is adequate.
    remediation: Add padding or use hitSlop to expand touch area beyond icon
  high:
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-HIGH-001
    signal: Touch targets smaller than 44x44px in mobile views
    evidence_pattern: Interactive elements between 24-44px on mobile
    explanation: |
      While 24px meets WCAG minimum, Apple and Google recommend
      44x44px (44pt/48dp) for comfortable touch interaction.
    remediation: Increase touch targets to 44x44px for optimal mobile experience
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-HIGH-002
    signal: Adjacent touch targets too close together
    evidence_pattern: Interactive elements with <8px spacing
    explanation: |
      Closely spaced targets lead to accidental taps on wrong elements.
      Adequate spacing is as important as target size.
    remediation: Add at least 8px spacing between touch targets
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-HIGH-003
    signal: Links in body text have inadequate touch area
    evidence_pattern: Inline text links without expanded hit area
    explanation: |
      Text links can be difficult to tap accurately, especially
      when small or on a single line.
    remediation: Add padding to links or ensure adequate line height
  medium:
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-MED-001
    signal: Checkbox/radio buttons smaller than recommended
    evidence_pattern: Form controls <44px without padding
    remediation: Expand clickable area around form controls
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-MED-002
    signal: Mobile navigation items too small
    evidence_pattern: Nav links <44px in mobile menu
    remediation: Size navigation items for comfortable touch
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-MED-003
    signal: Table row actions difficult to tap
    evidence_pattern: Small action icons in table rows
    remediation: Expand row action touch targets or use action menus
  low:
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-LOW-001
    signal: Touch targets adequate but could be larger
    remediation: Consider increasing to recommended 44x44px
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-LOW-002
    signal: Desktop-optimized controls not adapted for touch
    remediation: Increase control sizes in touch/mobile contexts
  positive:
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-POS-001
    signal: All touch targets meet 44x44px recommended size
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-POS-002
    signal: Adequate spacing between touch targets
  - id: TOUCHSIZE-POS-003
    signal: Form controls have expanded touch areas
