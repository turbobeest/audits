  what: |
    This audit evaluates how the application responds to different
    screen sizes, orientations, and device contexts. It examines
    breakpoint behavior, content reflow, touch vs pointer adaptation,
    and overall mobile-to-desktop continuity.
  why_it_matters: |
    Users access applications from countless device sizes and contexts.
    Poor responsive behavior causes content overflow, unusable interfaces,
    and broken functionality on certain devices. Good responsive design
    ensures a quality experience regardless of how users access the app.
  when_to_run:
  - During mobile optimization
  - When adding new features
  - After reports of display issues
  - During cross-device testing

signals:
  critical:
  - id: RESPONSIVE-CRIT-001
    signal: Content overflows viewport horizontally
    evidence_pattern: Horizontal scroll on mobile viewports
    explanation: |
      Horizontal scrolling on mobile breaks the expected interaction
      model and makes content difficult to access.
    remediation: Fix layout to fit within viewport width; use overflow handling
  - id: RESPONSIVE-CRIT-002
    signal: Interactive elements inaccessible on certain viewports
    evidence_pattern: Buttons or controls hidden or cut off
    explanation: |
      Users cannot complete tasks if controls are not accessible
      on their device.
    remediation: Ensure all interactive elements visible and accessible at all sizes
  high:
  - id: RESPONSIVE-HIGH-001
    signal: No viewport meta tag
    evidence_pattern: Missing or misconfigured viewport meta
    explanation: |
      Without proper viewport meta, mobile browsers scale pages
      incorrectly, making them difficult to use.
    remediation: 'Add viewport meta: <meta name=''viewport'' content=''width=device-width, initial-scale=1''>'
  - id: RESPONSIVE-HIGH-002
    signal: Fixed pixel widths break on small screens
    evidence_pattern: Elements with fixed width larger than mobile viewport
    explanation: |
      Fixed pixel widths that exceed mobile screen width cause
      overflow and broken layouts.
    remediation: Use relative units (%, vw) or max-width instead of fixed widths
  - id: RESPONSIVE-HIGH-003
    signal: Text too small to read on mobile
    evidence_pattern: Font size <16px on mobile or requiring zoom
    explanation: |
      Small text forces users to zoom, breaking the experience
      and causing usability issues.
    remediation: Use minimum 16px font size for body text on mobile
  medium:
  - id: RESPONSIVE-MED-001
    signal: Images not responsive
    evidence_pattern: Fixed-size images overflowing containers
    remediation: 'Use max-width: 100% on images; implement srcset for resolution'
  - id: RESPONSIVE-MED-002
    signal: Tables overflow on mobile
    evidence_pattern: Wide tables causing horizontal scroll
    remediation: Implement responsive tables (scroll, stack, or card layout)
  - id: RESPONSIVE-MED-003
    signal: Content reorganization not optimal for mobile
    evidence_indicators:
    - Important content below fold
    - Secondary content above primary
    remediation: Prioritize content order for mobile viewing
  low:
  - id: RESPONSIVE-LOW-001
    signal: Breakpoints could be smoother
    remediation: Add intermediate breakpoints for better transitions
  - id: RESPONSIVE-LOW-002
    signal: Touch-specific styles missing
    remediation: Add hover-alternative styles for touch devices
  positive:
  - id: RESPONSIVE-POS-001
    signal: Content fits all tested viewport sizes
  - id: RESPONSIVE-POS-002
    signal: Text readable at all sizes without zoom
  - id: RESPONSIVE-POS-003
    signal: Appropriate breakpoint system implemented
  - id: RESPONSIVE-POS-004
    signal: Touch-friendly styles applied on touch devices
