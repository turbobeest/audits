  what: |
    This audit examines cross-linking - contextual links between related
    content, features, and pages that help users discover relevant
    information. It evaluates:

    - Related content suggestions
    - Contextual feature links
    - See also / related items sections
    - In-content links to relevant pages
    - Feature cross-references
    - Documentation interconnections
    - User journey optimization through linking
  why_it_matters: |
    Cross-linking serves multiple purposes:
    - Helps users discover related content and features
    - Reduces reliance on navigation and search
    - Creates natural exploration paths
    - Improves content engagement metrics
    - Supports different user learning styles
    - Increases feature adoption through context

    Without cross-linking, users may never discover content or features
    that would be valuable to them.
  when_to_run:
  - Content discoverability review
  - Feature adoption analysis
  - User journey optimization
  - SEO internal linking audit
  - Documentation structure review

signals:
  critical:
  - id: CROSS-CRIT-001
    signal: Orphan content with no incoming links
    evidence_indicators:
    - Pages only accessible via direct URL
    - Content unreachable through navigation
    - Features with no contextual entry points
    explanation: |
      Orphan content is effectively invisible. Users cannot
      discover content that has no links pointing to it.
    remediation: Add contextual links from related content and navigation
  high:
  - id: CROSS-HIGH-001
    signal: Related content is obviously connected but not linked
    explanation: |
      When content is clearly related (same topic, same workflow),
      users expect links between them.
    remediation: Add bidirectional links between related content
  - id: CROSS-HIGH-002
    signal: Features mentioned but not linked in help/docs
    explanation: |
      Documentation that mentions features should link to them,
      not just describe them textually.
    remediation: Convert feature mentions to actionable links
  - id: CROSS-HIGH-003
    signal: Sequential content lacks next/previous navigation
    explanation: |
      Content that follows a sequence (tutorials, guides) should
      help users continue their journey.
    remediation: Add next/previous links for sequential content
  medium:
  - id: CROSS-MED-001
    signal: Related content suggestions not personalized
    remediation: Consider usage-based recommendations
  - id: CROSS-MED-002
    signal: Cross-links only at bottom of content
    remediation: Add contextual links within content where relevant
  - id: CROSS-MED-003
    signal: Link text not descriptive (click here, learn more)
    remediation: Use descriptive link text that indicates destination
  low:
  - id: CROSS-LOW-001
    signal: Related content section could show more items
  positive:
  - id: CROSS-POS-001
    signal: Rich contextual linking throughout content
  - id: CROSS-POS-002
    signal: Smart related content recommendations
  - id: CROSS-POS-003
    signal: Clear sequential navigation for series content
