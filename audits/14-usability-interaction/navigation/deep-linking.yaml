  what: |
    This audit examines deep linking capabilities - the ability to link
    directly to specific pages, content, or application states via URLs.
    It evaluates:

    - URL structure and readability
    - Deep link availability for key content
    - State preservation in URLs
    - Bookmarkability
    - Share functionality
    - URL parameter handling
    - Mobile app deep links (if applicable)
    - SEO implications
  why_it_matters: |
    Deep linking is essential for:
    - Sharing specific content with others
    - Bookmarking for later return
    - Search engine indexing
    - Analytics and tracking
    - Customer support (sending users to specific pages)
    - Integration with external systems

    Applications without deep linking frustrate users who cannot
    share or bookmark content, and miss SEO opportunities.
  when_to_run:
  - URL structure review
  - SEO audit
  - Sharing functionality review
  - SPA architecture assessment
  - User complaints about bookmarking/sharing

signals:
  critical:
  - id: DEEP-CRIT-001
    signal: Application is single URL (no deep linking at all)
    evidence_indicators:
    - URL never changes regardless of navigation
    - All content loads under one URL
    - Refresh always returns to home
    explanation: |
      Without any deep linking, users cannot bookmark, share,
      or return to specific content. This is a fundamental UX failure.
    remediation: Implement proper routing with unique URLs for distinct pages
  - id: DEEP-CRIT-002
    signal: Deep links lose critical application state
    evidence_indicators:
    - Following deep link requires re-authentication
    - User loses cart/progress when using deep link
    - Application crashes when accessing deep link directly
    explanation: |
      Deep links must reliably restore the intended state.
      Broken deep links undermine sharing and bookmarking.
    remediation: Ensure deep links properly restore all necessary state
  high:
  - id: DEEP-HIGH-001
    signal: Important content/features not accessible via unique URLs
    explanation: |
      Key content and features should have shareable, bookmarkable URLs.
    remediation: Add unique URLs for all significant content and states
  - id: DEEP-HIGH-002
    signal: URLs contain sensitive information
    explanation: |
      URLs with sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) can be
      exposed in browser history, logs, and shared links.
    remediation: Never include sensitive information in URLs
  - id: DEEP-HIGH-003
    signal: Deep links don't work when opened in new session
    explanation: |
      Deep links must work independently, not relying on
      prior session state.
    remediation: Ensure deep links work in fresh browser sessions
  medium:
  - id: DEEP-MED-001
    signal: URLs are cryptic or not human-readable
    remediation: Use descriptive, readable URL slugs
  - id: DEEP-MED-002
    signal: Filter/sort state not preserved in URL
    remediation: Encode relevant UI state in URL parameters
  - id: DEEP-MED-003
    signal: No share functionality for deep links
    remediation: Add share/copy link buttons for important content
  low:
  - id: DEEP-LOW-001
    signal: URLs unnecessarily long or complex
  positive:
  - id: DEEP-POS-001
    signal: Clean, readable URLs for all content
  - id: DEEP-POS-002
    signal: State preserved in shareable URLs
  - id: DEEP-POS-003
    signal: Easy share/copy link functionality
