  what: |
    This audit examines breadcrumb navigation - the secondary navigation
    scheme that reveals the user's location in a site hierarchy. It evaluates:

    - Breadcrumb presence and placement
    - Accuracy of path representation
    - Clickability and interaction
    - Visual design and clarity
    - Mobile responsiveness
    - Accessibility compliance
    - Consistency across the application
  why_it_matters: |
    Breadcrumbs serve critical navigation functions:
    - Show users their current location in the hierarchy
    - Enable quick navigation to parent pages
    - Reduce required clicks/taps for traversing hierarchies
    - Support mental model formation
    - Provide emergency escape routes

    While not required for all sites, breadcrumbs are essential for
    deep hierarchical content structures.
  when_to_run:
  - Navigation audit
  - Deep content structure design
  - User complaints about getting lost
  - E-commerce product navigation review
  - Documentation site assessment

signals:
  critical:
  - id: BREAD-CRIT-001
    signal: Breadcrumbs show incorrect path
    evidence_indicators:
    - Breadcrumb path doesn't match actual hierarchy
    - Levels skipped or duplicated
    - Labels don't match page content
    explanation: |
      Incorrect breadcrumbs are worse than no breadcrumbs - they
      mislead users and destroy trust in navigation aids.
    remediation: Fix breadcrumb logic to accurately reflect true hierarchy
  - id: BREAD-CRIT-002
    signal: Breadcrumb links broken or non-functional
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clicking breadcrumb items does nothing
    - Links lead to 404 pages
    - Some levels not clickable without indication
    explanation: |
      Breadcrumbs that look clickable but don't work frustrate users
      and remove a key navigation escape route.
    remediation: Ensure all breadcrumb levels (except current) are clickable
  high:
  - id: BREAD-HIGH-001
    signal: Deep hierarchical content lacks breadcrumbs
    explanation: |
      Content that is 3+ levels deep requires breadcrumbs for
      effective navigation and location awareness.
    remediation: Implement breadcrumbs for all hierarchical content
  - id: BREAD-HIGH-002
    signal: Breadcrumbs not accessible to screen readers
    explanation: |
      Breadcrumbs must be accessible to all users, including those
      using assistive technology.
    remediation: Implement proper ARIA breadcrumb pattern
  - id: BREAD-HIGH-003
    signal: Breadcrumb placement inconsistent or hidden
    explanation: |
      Users expect breadcrumbs in a consistent location, typically
      near the top of the content area.
    remediation: Place breadcrumbs consistently at top of content area
  medium:
  - id: BREAD-MED-001
    signal: Mobile breadcrumbs truncated without indication
    remediation: Show truncation indicators; allow horizontal scroll or expansion
  - id: BREAD-MED-002
    signal: Current page included as clickable link
    remediation: Current page should be text only, not a link
  - id: BREAD-MED-003
    signal: Missing structured data markup
    remediation: Add Schema.org BreadcrumbList markup for SEO
  low:
  - id: BREAD-LOW-001
    signal: Breadcrumb separators could be clearer
  positive:
  - id: BREAD-POS-001
    signal: Accurate, consistent breadcrumbs throughout
  - id: BREAD-POS-002
    signal: Proper ARIA implementation
  - id: BREAD-POS-003
    signal: Mobile-optimized breadcrumb display
