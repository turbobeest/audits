  what: |
    This audit examines navigation menu organization - how menu items
    are grouped, labeled, and structured for user comprehension. It evaluates:

    - Menu item grouping and categorization
    - Label clarity and consistency
    - Menu item ordering and prioritization
    - Submenu depth and organization
    - Menu patterns (hamburger, mega menu, dropdown)
    - Mobile menu adaptation
    - Menu accessibility
  why_it_matters: |
    Menu organization directly affects:
    - User ability to find features and content
    - Cognitive load during navigation
    - Learning curve for new users
    - Expert user efficiency
    - Overall perception of application quality

    Poorly organized menus frustrate users and hide features,
    while well-organized menus guide users naturally to their goals.
  when_to_run:
  - Navigation redesign
  - Information architecture review
  - New feature integration planning
  - User feedback indicates menu confusion
  - Card sorting or tree testing follow-up

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MENU-CRIT-001
    signal: Menu labels don't match destination content
    evidence_indicators:
    - Clicking menu item leads to unexpected content
    - Labels use internal jargon users don't understand
    - Ambiguous labels could mean multiple things
    explanation: |
      Menu labels must accurately predict their destinations.
      Misleading labels cause navigation failures and frustration.
    remediation: Revise labels to clearly describe destinations; use user terminology
  - id: MENU-CRIT-002
    signal: Primary features buried in submenus or hidden
    evidence_indicators:
    - Core features only accessible via deep submenus
    - Important items hidden in hamburger menus
    - Users can't find key features
    explanation: |
      Primary features should be prominently accessible. Hiding
      them reduces feature discovery and usage.
    remediation: Elevate primary features to top-level navigation
  high:
  - id: MENU-HIGH-001
    signal: Too many top-level menu items (>7-9)
    explanation: |
      Excessive top-level items overwhelm users and make
      scanning difficult. Users work better with focused choices.
    remediation: Consolidate related items; create logical groupings
  - id: MENU-HIGH-002
    signal: Menu groupings don't match user mental models
    explanation: |
      When organization doesn't match how users think about
      content, they struggle to find items.
    remediation: Conduct card sorting; reorganize based on user expectations
  - id: MENU-HIGH-003
    signal: Submenus more than 2 levels deep
    explanation: |
      Deep submenu hierarchies are difficult to navigate,
      especially on mobile devices.
    remediation: Flatten hierarchy; use alternative navigation patterns
  medium:
  - id: MENU-MED-001
    signal: Menu item ordering doesn't reflect usage or importance
    remediation: Order by frequency of use or logical workflow
  - id: MENU-MED-002
    signal: No visual grouping or separators for related items
    remediation: Use visual grouping to aid scanning
  - id: MENU-MED-003
    signal: Mobile menu significantly harder to use than desktop
    remediation: Optimize mobile menu patterns
  low:
  - id: MENU-LOW-001
    signal: Menu icons decorative rather than meaningful
  positive:
  - id: MENU-POS-001
    signal: Clear, descriptive menu labels
  - id: MENU-POS-002
    signal: Logical groupings matching user mental models
  - id: MENU-POS-003
    signal: Appropriate menu depth and complexity
