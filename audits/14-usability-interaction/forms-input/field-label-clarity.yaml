  what: |
    This audit examines form field labels to ensure they clearly communicate
    what information users should enter. It evaluates label text clarity,
    proper HTML label associations, helper text usage, and the avoidance of
    anti-patterns like placeholder-only labels.
  why_it_matters: |
    Clear labels are the primary means by which users understand what to
    enter in a form field. Ambiguous, missing, or poorly associated labels
    lead to user errors, form abandonment, and accessibility failures.
    Screen reader users depend entirely on properly associated labels to
    navigate and complete forms.
  when_to_run:
  - During design and development of new forms
  - When form error rates are higher than expected
  - During accessibility audits
  - When internationalizing forms

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FIELDLABEL-CRIT-001
    signal: Input field has no label or accessible name
    evidence_pattern: <input without associated <label>, aria-label, or aria-labelledby
    explanation: |
      Screen reader users cannot determine the purpose of unlabeled inputs.
      This is a WCAG 2.2 Level A failure (4.1.2 Name, Role, Value).
    remediation: Add a visible label element with proper for/id association, or use aria-label for icon-only
      inputs
  - id: FIELDLABEL-CRIT-002
    signal: Label uses placeholder attribute only (no visible label)
    evidence_pattern: Input with placeholder but no <label> element
    explanation: |
      Placeholders disappear when users begin typing, removing the context
      for what was expected. This causes errors and is an accessibility failure.
    remediation: Add visible labels above or beside inputs; use placeholders only for example values
  high:
  - id: FIELDLABEL-HIGH-001
    signal: Label text is ambiguous or generic
    evidence_indicators:
    - Labels like 'Name' without context (first? last? company?)
    - Labels like 'ID' or 'Number' without specification
    - Single-word labels for complex fields
    explanation: |
      Ambiguous labels force users to guess what's expected, leading to
      errors and form abandonment.
    remediation: Use specific, descriptive labels like 'First Name' or 'Employee ID Number'
  - id: FIELDLABEL-HIGH-002
    signal: Label is visually hidden but field is not self-evident
    evidence_pattern: sr-only|visually-hidden class on labels for non-obvious fields
    explanation: |
      Hidden labels should only be used for fields where the visual context
      makes the purpose obvious to sighted users.
    remediation: Make labels visible unless truly redundant (e.g., search icon next to search field)
  medium:
  - id: FIELDLABEL-MED-001
    signal: Helper text needed but not provided
    evidence_indicators:
    - Complex fields without format hints
    - Fields with specific requirements not explained
    remediation: Add aria-describedby helper text explaining format or requirements
  - id: FIELDLABEL-MED-002
    signal: Label uses jargon or technical terms
    evidence_indicators:
    - Domain-specific abbreviations without explanation
    - Technical terms unfamiliar to general users
    remediation: Use plain language; add helper text for unavoidable technical terms
  low:
  - id: FIELDLABEL-LOW-001
    signal: Label could be more concise
    remediation: Shorten labels while preserving clarity
  - id: FIELDLABEL-LOW-002
    signal: Inconsistent label capitalization
    remediation: Standardize on sentence case or title case throughout
  positive:
  - id: FIELDLABEL-POS-001
    signal: All inputs have properly associated visible labels
  - id: FIELDLABEL-POS-002
    signal: Helper text provided for fields with format requirements
  - id: FIELDLABEL-POS-003
    signal: Labels use clear, plain language
