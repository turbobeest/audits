  what: |
    This audit evaluates multi-step (wizard-style) forms for proper
    implementation of navigation, progress indication, step validation,
    and data persistence. It examines how users move between steps,
    whether they can review and edit previous steps, and how the form
    handles interruptions.
  why_it_matters: |
    Multi-step forms are used for complex processes like checkouts,
    registrations, and applications. Poor implementation leads to user
    confusion, data loss, and high abandonment rates. Users need clear
    understanding of where they are in the process, what's coming next,
    and confidence that their data is safe.
  when_to_run:
  - When designing or implementing multi-step forms
  - When multi-step form abandonment is high
  - When users report confusion or data loss
  - During checkout optimization projects

signals:
  critical:
  - id: MULTISTEP-CRIT-001
    signal: Form data lost when navigating between steps
    evidence_indicators:
    - State not persisted when moving back
    - Browser refresh clears all entered data
    - Session timeout loses all progress
    explanation: |
      Data loss is extremely frustrating and a primary cause of form
      abandonment. Users expect their input to be preserved.
    remediation: Persist form data in session storage or backend; implement auto-save
  - id: MULTISTEP-CRIT-002
    signal: No way to navigate back to previous steps
    evidence_pattern: Back button disabled or missing
    explanation: |
      Users need to review and edit previous entries. One-way flows
      trap users and force them to start over for corrections.
    remediation: Allow navigation to any completed step via progress indicator or back button
  high:
  - id: MULTISTEP-HIGH-001
    signal: No progress indicator showing current position
    evidence_pattern: Multi-step form without stepper or progress bar
    explanation: |
      Users need to understand where they are in the process, how many
      steps remain, and how long the process will take.
    remediation: Add progress indicator showing current step and total steps
  - id: MULTISTEP-HIGH-002
    signal: Progress indicator not showing step names
    evidence_pattern: Progress shows numbers only, not step content
    explanation: |
      Named steps help users understand what information is needed and
      mentally prepare for upcoming steps.
    remediation: Show descriptive step names like 'Shipping', 'Payment', 'Review'
  - id: MULTISTEP-HIGH-003
    signal: No review step before final submission
    evidence_pattern: Final step is submit without review opportunity
    explanation: |
      Users need to verify all entered information before committing,
      especially for purchases or legal agreements.
    remediation: Add a summary/review step showing all entered data before submission
  medium:
  - id: MULTISTEP-MED-001
    signal: Steps not validated before progression
    evidence_pattern: Can proceed to next step with invalid data
    explanation: |
      Allowing progression with errors leads to submission failures
      that require navigating back through multiple steps.
    remediation: Validate current step before allowing navigation to next step
  - id: MULTISTEP-MED-002
    signal: Unequal step lengths create pacing issues
    evidence_indicators:
    - First step has 10 fields, second step has 1 field
    - Significantly different completion times per step
    remediation: Balance field counts across steps for consistent pacing
  - id: MULTISTEP-MED-003
    signal: Cannot edit previous steps from review
    evidence_pattern: Review step without edit links to specific sections
    remediation: Allow editing specific sections directly from review step
  low:
  - id: MULTISTEP-LOW-001
    signal: Progress indicator not clickable for navigation
    remediation: Make completed steps in progress indicator clickable
  - id: MULTISTEP-LOW-002
    signal: No estimated time to complete
    remediation: Consider showing estimated completion time
  - id: MULTISTEP-LOW-003
    signal: Step transitions lack smooth animation
    remediation: Add subtle transition animations between steps
  positive:
  - id: MULTISTEP-POS-001
    signal: Clear progress indicator with step names
  - id: MULTISTEP-POS-002
    signal: Data persisted across navigation and page refreshes
  - id: MULTISTEP-POS-003
    signal: Review step allows editing any section
  - id: MULTISTEP-POS-004
    signal: Balanced step lengths for consistent pacing
