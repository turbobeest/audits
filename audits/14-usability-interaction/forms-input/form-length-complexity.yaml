  what: |
    This audit evaluates form length and complexity to ensure forms
    are appropriately sized for their purpose. It examines total field
    count, required vs optional fields, conditional logic complexity,
    and opportunities to reduce form burden through smart defaults,
    progressive disclosure, or elimination of unnecessary fields.
  why_it_matters: |
    Form length directly correlates with abandonment rates. Research
    shows that each additional field reduces conversion by approximately
    3-5%. Complex forms with many fields overwhelm users, increase error
    rates, and create negative user experiences. Optimizing form length
    is one of the highest-impact UX improvements possible.
  when_to_run:
  - When form completion rates are below target
  - During design of new forms
  - When analyzing conversion funnels
  - During periodic UX optimization reviews

signals:
  critical:
  - id: FORMLENGTH-CRIT-001
    signal: Form collects unnecessary sensitive data
    evidence_indicators:
    - Social security number requested for non-financial forms
    - Date of birth for services not requiring age verification
    - Excessive personal information for simple signups
    explanation: |
      Collecting unnecessary sensitive data creates privacy concerns,
      legal liability, and significantly increases form abandonment.
    remediation: Remove fields collecting data not essential for the service
  high:
  - id: FORMLENGTH-HIGH-001
    signal: Registration form exceeds 6 fields
    evidence_pattern: Signup/registration form with >6 input fields
    explanation: |
      Research shows signup conversion drops dramatically beyond 6 fields.
      Each additional field reduces completion by 3-5%.
    remediation: Reduce to essential fields; collect additional data post-registration
  - id: FORMLENGTH-HIGH-002
    signal: Checkout form exceeds industry benchmarks
    evidence_pattern: Checkout with >12 form fields (industry average)
    explanation: |
      Baymard Institute research shows average checkout has 12 fields.
      Forms significantly exceeding this benchmark hurt conversion.
    remediation: Use address autocomplete, smart defaults, and guest checkout
  - id: FORMLENGTH-HIGH-003
    signal: Optional fields outnumber required fields
    evidence_pattern: More optional than required fields in a form
    explanation: |
      Too many optional fields suggest data is being collected speculatively
      rather than because it's needed, creating unnecessary friction.
    remediation: Remove optional fields that are rarely filled or provide little value
  medium:
  - id: FORMLENGTH-MED-001
    signal: Form could use smart defaults
    evidence_indicators:
    - Country field without geo-IP default
    - Date fields without sensible defaults
    - Repeated data entry across related fields
    remediation: Implement smart defaults based on context and user data
  - id: FORMLENGTH-MED-002
    signal: Complex conditional logic increases cognitive load
    evidence_pattern: Multiple nested conditionals showing/hiding fields
    explanation: |
      While progressive disclosure can reduce form length, overly complex
      conditionals can confuse users about what's required.
    remediation: Simplify conditional logic or split into clear multi-step flow
  - id: FORMLENGTH-MED-003
    signal: Separate fields for data that could be combined
    evidence_indicators:
    - Separate area code and phone number fields
    - Separate first, middle, and last name fields when not needed
    remediation: Combine fields where separate inputs don't provide value
  low:
  - id: FORMLENGTH-LOW-001
    signal: Form lacks progress indication for longer forms
    remediation: Add progress indicators for forms with 5+ sections
  - id: FORMLENGTH-LOW-002
    signal: All fields visible without scroll consideration
    remediation: Consider above-the-fold placement for critical fields
  positive:
  - id: FORMLENGTH-POS-001
    signal: Form collects only essential data
  - id: FORMLENGTH-POS-002
    signal: Smart defaults reduce required user input
  - id: FORMLENGTH-POS-003
    signal: Progressive disclosure used effectively
  - id: FORMLENGTH-POS-004
    signal: Address autocomplete implemented
