  what: |
    This audit examines the onboarding flow - the structured sequence of
    interactions designed to introduce new users to an application's key
    features and help them achieve initial setup. It evaluates:

    - Setup wizard design and step progression
    - Required vs optional steps
    - Skip and escape mechanisms
    - Progress indication
    - Contextual guidance
    - Account/profile setup flows
    - Feature introduction sequences
    - Tutorial and walkthrough quality

  why_it_matters: |
    Onboarding is the bridge between user acquisition and user activation.
    A well-designed onboarding flow:
    - Increases activation rates by 50-100%
    - Reduces time-to-value
    - Decreases early churn
    - Lowers support burden
    - Sets users up for long-term success

    Poor onboarding leads to frustrated users who never experience the
    product's full value, resulting in lost revenue and negative reviews.

  when_to_run:
    - "New product launch"
    - "Onboarding redesign"
    - "Activation rate optimization"
    - "User feedback indicates setup confusion"
    - "High drop-off during initial setup"

signals:
  critical:
    - id: "ONBOARD-CRIT-001"
      signal: "Mandatory onboarding blocks access to core features"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "Users cannot proceed without completing all steps"
        - "No skip option for non-essential steps"
        - "Session abandonment during mandatory steps"
      explanation: |
        Forcing users through lengthy mandatory onboarding creates friction
        and prevents users from exploring the product at their own pace.
      remediation: "Make non-essential steps skippable; allow exploration first"

    - id: "ONBOARD-CRIT-002"
      signal: "Onboarding completion rate below 20%"
      evidence_indicators:
        - "High abandonment at early steps"
        - "Users creating accounts but never activating"
      explanation: |
        Very low completion rates indicate fundamental problems with the
        onboarding design, length, or relevance.
      remediation: "Simplify flow, reduce required steps, improve guidance"

  high:
    - id: "ONBOARD-HIGH-001"
      signal: "No progress indication during multi-step onboarding"
      explanation: |
        Without progress indication, users don't know how much time/effort
        remains, leading to anxiety and abandonment.
      remediation: "Add clear progress indicator showing current step and total"

    - id: "ONBOARD-HIGH-002"
      signal: "Onboarding exceeds 5 steps without breaks"
      explanation: |
        Long uninterrupted sequences overwhelm users and reduce completion.
      remediation: "Break into logical segments with value delivery between"

    - id: "ONBOARD-HIGH-003"
      signal: "Required information collection exceeds actual needs"
      explanation: |
        Collecting unnecessary information increases friction and raises
        privacy concerns.
      remediation: "Only collect essential information; defer optional collection"

  medium:
    - id: "ONBOARD-MED-001"
      signal: "No ability to return to skipped onboarding steps"
      remediation: "Provide access to onboarding content from settings/help"

    - id: "ONBOARD-MED-002"
      signal: "Onboarding content not personalized to user type"
      remediation: "Segment onboarding by user role or use case"

    - id: "ONBOARD-MED-003"
      signal: "Tooltips and guidance disappear permanently after first view"
