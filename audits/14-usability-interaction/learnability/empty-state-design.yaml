  what: |
    This audit examines empty state design - how the interface presents
    and handles situations where there is no data to display. It evaluates:

    - First-time user empty states
    - No results states (search, filters)
    - Cleared/deleted content states
    - Error-caused empty states
    - Permission-denied states
    - Guidance and call-to-action quality
    - Visual design of empty states
  why_it_matters: |
    Empty states are critical moments in the user experience:
    - They're often the first thing new users see
    - They guide users toward productive actions
    - They prevent confusion about missing data
    - They set expectations about what belongs in a space
    - They can convert blank screens into engagement opportunities

    Poorly designed empty states lead to user confusion, abandoned
    sessions, and missed opportunities for user engagement.
  when_to_run:
  - New feature development
  - Onboarding optimization
  - User engagement initiatives
  - UI/UX review
  - First-use experience audit

    purpose: Catalog all empty state locations and designs
  - tool: Screenshot comparison
    purpose: Document empty states visually
signals:
  critical:
  - id: EMPTY-CRIT-001
    signal: Empty state shows raw null/undefined or blank screen
    evidence_indicators:
    - Completely blank content area
    - Error text like 'null' or 'undefined' visible
    - No indication of what should be there
    explanation: |
      Raw blank screens or technical error text confuse users and
      make the application appear broken or incomplete.
    remediation: Design intentional empty states for all zero-data scenarios
  - id: EMPTY-CRIT-002
    signal: Empty state provides no guidance on what to do next
    evidence_indicators:
    - No call-to-action in empty state
    - No explanation of what belongs in the space
    - Users report not knowing how to proceed
    explanation: |
      Empty states without guidance leave users stuck, unable to
      understand how to populate the space.
    remediation: Add clear CTAs and explanatory text to all empty states
  high:
  - id: EMPTY-HIGH-001
    signal: Empty state CTA is not actionable or leads nowhere
    explanation: |
      A CTA that doesn't work or leads to a dead end is worse than
      no CTA at all.
    remediation: Ensure all empty state CTAs are functional and helpful
  - id: EMPTY-HIGH-002
    signal: No distinction between 'never had data' and 'data cleared'
    explanation: |
      Users need to understand whether they're seeing a fresh start
      or whether content was removed/deleted.
    remediation: Design contextually appropriate empty states
  - id: EMPTY-HIGH-003
    signal: Search/filter empty states don't suggest alternatives
    explanation: |
      No-results states should help users find what they're looking for
      through alternative approaches.
    remediation: Provide suggestions, related items, or clear filter options
  medium:
  - id: EMPTY-MED-001
    signal: Empty state visual design inconsistent with app style
    remediation: Ensure empty states match overall design system
  - id: EMPTY-MED-002
    signal: Empty state text is generic across different contexts
    remediation: Customize empty state messaging per context
  low:
  - id: EMPTY-LOW-001
    signal: Empty state illustrations/icons are decorative but not helpful
  positive:
  - id: EMPTY-POS-001
    signal: Empty states provide clear, contextual guidance
  - id: EMPTY-POS-002
    signal: First-time empty states include onboarding elements
  - id: EMPTY-POS-003
    signal: No-results states offer alternative actions
