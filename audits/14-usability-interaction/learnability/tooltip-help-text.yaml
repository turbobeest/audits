  what: |
    This audit examines contextual help mechanisms - tooltips, help text,
    inline hints, and microcopy that provide just-in-time assistance.
    It evaluates:

    - Tooltip presence and quality on interactive elements
    - Form field hints and help text
    - Icon labels and explanations
    - Error message helpfulness
    - Contextual help links
    - Placeholder text usage
    - Microcopy clarity and tone
  why_it_matters: |
    Effective contextual help:
    - Reduces user confusion without requiring documentation lookup
    - Prevents errors before they occur
    - Supports self-service learning
    - Decreases support requests
    - Improves form completion rates
    - Makes complex features accessible

    Poor or missing help text leads to user frustration, errors,
    and increased support burden.
  when_to_run:
  - Interface usability review
  - Form optimization
  - Support ticket analysis shows common questions
  - New feature release
  - Accessibility audit

signals:
  critical:
  - id: HELP-CRIT-001
    signal: Form fields lack any help text or labels
    evidence_pattern: <input(?![^>]*aria-label)(?![^>]*aria-describedby)[^>]*>
    evidence_indicators:
    - Input fields with no visible label
    - No help text for complex fields
    - Icons without text labels or tooltips
    explanation: |
      Form fields without labels or help text are inaccessible and
      confusing for all users.
    remediation: Add visible labels and contextual help for all inputs
  high:
  - id: HELP-HIGH-001
    signal: Tooltips contain essential information not available elsewhere
    explanation: |
      If critical information is only in tooltips, mobile users and
      screen reader users may never see it.
    remediation: Ensure essential information is in visible text; use tooltips for supplemental info
  - id: HELP-HIGH-002
    signal: Help text uses technical jargon users won't understand
    explanation: |
      Help text should clarify, not confuse. Technical language defeats
      the purpose of providing assistance.
    remediation: Rewrite help text in plain language appropriate for users
  - id: HELP-HIGH-003
    signal: Tooltips not accessible via keyboard or touch
    explanation: |
      Tooltips that only appear on hover exclude keyboard and mobile users.
    remediation: Make tooltips accessible via focus and tap interactions
  medium:
  - id: HELP-MED-001
    signal: Placeholder text used as only form label
    remediation: Add visible labels; use placeholders only for examples
  - id: HELP-MED-002
    signal: Tooltips obscure related content when displayed
    remediation: Position tooltips to avoid covering important elements
  - id: HELP-MED-003
    signal: Inconsistent tooltip trigger behavior across interface
    remediation: Standardize tooltip appearance timing and triggers
  low:
  - id: HELP-LOW-001
    signal: Help text tone inconsistent with brand voice
  positive:
  - id: HELP-POS-001
    signal: Clear, concise help text on all complex form fields
  - id: HELP-POS-002
    signal: Tooltips provide useful context without being essential
  - id: HELP-POS-003
    signal: Accessible tooltips that work with keyboard and touch
