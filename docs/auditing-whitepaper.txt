# Software Stack Audit Taxonomy: A Whitepaper

> Building the most comprehensive, multi-dimensional taxonomy of software stack audits ever assembledâ€”designed to serve as knowledge grounding for AI-powered audit agents.

---

## Executive Summary

Modern software systems are complex, multi-layered, and subject to an ever-expanding set of concerns: security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, compliance requirements, accessibility standards, and more. Traditional audit approachesâ€”manual checklists, point-in-time assessments, siloed expertiseâ€”cannot scale to meet these challenges.

This project establishes a **comprehensive taxonomy of software audits** that serves dual purposes:

1. **Human Reference**: An exhaustive catalog of every audit lens applicable to software systems
2. **AI Agent Grounding**: Structured knowledge that enables AI agents to perform sophisticated, context-aware audits

The taxonomy currently defines **43 categories** organized into 6 clusters, with support for **modular industry overlays** that add domain-specific requirements. At completion, we estimate **1,000+ individual audits** will be cataloged.

---

## The Problem

### Audit Knowledge is Fragmented

Security experts know security. Performance engineers know performance. Compliance teams know regulations. But software systems don't respect these boundariesâ€”a single change can have security, performance, compliance, and user experience implications simultaneously.

**Current state:**
- Expertise is siloed within teams and individuals
- Audit checklists are incomplete, outdated, or overly generic
- Cross-cutting concerns fall through the cracks
- Institutional knowledge leaves when people leave

### Manual Audits Don't Scale

A thorough security audit of a modern microservices application might examine authentication, authorization, input validation, secrets management, network security, dependency vulnerabilities, and moreâ€”across dozens of services. Multiply this by performance, reliability, accessibility, compliance, and other dimensions.

**The math doesn't work:**
- Too many dimensions to audit manually
- Too much code to review line-by-line
- Too many configurations to verify
- Too fast a release cadence to keep up

### Context is Everything

Generic audit checklists produce generic findings. Real audits require understanding:
- What does the PRD say about performance requirements?
- What compliance frameworks apply to this system?
- What are the stated SLAs?
- What business rules must be enforced?

Without project-specific context, audits produce noise instead of signal.

## The Solution

### A Comprehensive Taxonomy

We are building an exhaustive catalog of audit concerns, organized hierarchically:

```
Category (Level 1)
â””â”€â”€ Subcategory (Level 2)
    â””â”€â”€ Audit (Level 3)
        â””â”€â”€ Deep Dive (Level 4, optional)
```

**Example:**
```
Security & Trust
â””â”€â”€ Authentication
    â””â”€â”€ OAuth2 Implementation Audit
        â””â”€â”€ Token Refresh Timing Window Analysis
        â””â”€â”€ PKCE Implementation Verification
```

This structure allows:
- **Breadth**: Cover every meaningful audit dimension
- **Depth**: Drill into specific technical concerns
- **Navigation**: Find relevant audits quickly
- **Composition**: Cherry-pick audits for specific projects

### 43 Categories Across 6 Clusters

| Cluster | Count | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Core Technical | 12 | Security, performance, reliability, architecture, data |
| Infrastructure | 4 | Compute, network, storage, IaC |
| Human & Experience | 7 | Usability, accessibility, trust, ethics |
| Process & Governance | 7 | Compliance, testing, documentation, risk |
| Economics & Dependencies | 3 | Cost, dependencies, legacy systems |
| Specialized Domains | 10 | ML/AI, sensors, real-time, blockchain, quantum, metaverse |

### Modular Industry Overlays

Rather than bloating the core taxonomy with every industry-specific requirement, we maintain **modular overlays** that extend core categories:

```
/industry-overlays/
â”œâ”€â”€ healthcare/          # HIPAA, HL7, FHIR, FDA
â”œâ”€â”€ finance-banking/     # SOX, PCI-DSS, regulatory reporting
â”œâ”€â”€ defense-intelligence/ # Classification, ITAR, TEMPEST
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Each overlay:
- Lists applicable standards and certifications
- Adds industry-specific audits to existing categories
- Defines domain terminology mappings
- References relevant regulatory bodies

This approach keeps the core taxonomy clean while supporting deep industry specialization.

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Audits Have Two Components

Every audit has a **static framework** (what we're building) and requires **project-specific grounding** (what the project provides):

| Component | Source | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Static Framework | This taxonomy | "Check that OAuth2 implementation uses PKCE" |
| Project Grounding | Project artifacts | "PRD states authentication must support SSO with Okta" |

Some audits are **complete**â€”they can run without project context:
- SQL Injection Audit
- TLS Configuration Audit
- Dependency Vulnerability Audit

Some audits are **incomplete by design**â€”they require discovery first:
- Requirements Traceability Audit (needs: requirements repo)
- SLA Compliance Audit (needs: stated SLAs)
- Business Rule Coverage Audit (needs: business rules from specs)

The taxonomy explicitly declares this via the `completeness` field:

```yaml
audit: Business Rule Coverage Audit
completeness: requires_discovery

discovery_inputs:
  - source: requirements_repo
    extract: business_rules
    format: structured_rules_list
```

### 2. LLM-Augmented Deep Dives

The audit isn't just "does a PRD exist?" It's designed to:

1. **Ingest project artifacts** (requirements, PRDs, ADRs, architecture docs)
2. **Extract structured information** using LLM capabilities
3. **Cross-reference** extracted requirements against implementation
4. **Perform deep validation** ("PRD says 10k concurrent usersâ€”does architecture support this?")

| Category | Checklist Approach | LLM-Augmented Approach |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Requirements Quality | "Does RFC 2119 language exist?" | Extract all MUST/SHOULD/MAY, trace each to implementation, flag gaps |
| Architecture Alignment | "Is there an architecture doc?" | Parse docs, extract boundaries, validate code matches stated design |
| Compliance | "Is GDPR mentioned?" | Extract data handling requirements, trace data flows, validate each PII touchpoint |

### 3. Agent-Ready Structure

Each audit is structured to support AI agent execution:

```yaml
audit: OAuth2 Implementation Audit
tier: expert  # focused | expert | phd

agent_context:
  cognitive_mode: critical
  ensemble_role: auditor
  escalate_when:
    - Novel OAuth extension encountered
    - Custom authentication layer involved

signals:
  critical:
    - Authorization code used without PKCE
  high:
    - Token refresh without rotation
  medium:
    - Token lifetimes longer than necessary

remediation:
  critical:
    - Implement PKCE for all public clients
```

**Tier mapping:**

| Audit Complexity | Agent Tier | Rationale |
|------------------|------------|-----------|
| Checklist-based | Focused | Clear criteria, pattern matching |
| Domain expertise | Expert | Specialized knowledge, judgment |
| Novel/research | PhD | First-principles reasoning |

**Cognitive modes:**

| Phase | Mode | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| Discovery | Informative | Present findings without advocacy |
| Analysis | Critical | Assume flaws exist until proven otherwise |
| Remediation | Evaluative | Weigh options with tradeoffs |
| Verification | Critical | No benefit of the doubt |

### 4. Cherry-Pick Per Project

Not every project needs every audit. The taxonomy is a **menu**, not a mandate.

A healthcare SaaS might select:
- Security & Trust (full)
- Compliance & Governance (with healthcare overlay)
- Accessibility & Inclusion
- Performance & Efficiency (subset)
- Data & State Management

An embedded automotive system might select:
- Real-Time & Embedded (full)
- Sensors & Physical Systems
- Reliability & Resilience
- Security & Trust (subset)
- Compliance (with automotive overlay)
